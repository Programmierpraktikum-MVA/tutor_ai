        "body": "Free workspace content older than one year will be deleted\nWe wanted to let you know about a change in policy for free workspaces.\nWhat is changing?\nWorkspaces’ data, including files, messages, and other content that is older than one year will no longer be stored. Free workspaces will continue to have full access to the past 90 days of message history and file storage. This change will not impact workspaces on other plans, such as Slack Pro.\nWhen will this take effect?\nThis policy will begin taking effect August 26th, 2024. Workspaces will be notified prior to the policy impacting their workspace.\nWhat does this mean for you?\nYour workspace, Slack , is on a free Slack plan. This workspace has content that is older than one year which will be deleted once the policy takes effect. Moving forward, Slack will not retain messages and files older than one year for a workspace. This policy will impact your workspace starting August 26th, 2024.\nTo retain access to content older than a year, the workspace needs to be on a paid Slack plan. These plans can be reviewed on our plan page. Free teams will continue to retain access to messages and content sent in the last 90 days.\nIf your team chooses to upgrade to a paid plan after the policy goes into effect, you will not be able to recover any content that has been deleted under our new policy.\nS\nSlack\nWorkspace URL: slack-hik4376.slack.com\nSIGN IN\nQuestions?

        "body": "Hey,\n\n1) Now you are using our Basic Dedicated GPU Server-K40, its GPU module is M40, and the RAM is 64GB.\nOk. Thanks for the heads-up. I checked again and we are not really limited by RAM, so 32G RAM would be ok.\n\n2) Would you still would like to change the plan from the current Basic Dedicated GPU Server-K40 to our Professional GPU VPS - A4000 and keep the new plan until July 2025? If yes, we will help you place a new Professional GPU VPS - A4000 order with Ubuntu 20 OS. Is that alfight for you? \nYes, perfect. Thank you so much.\n\nBest,\nDamien",

First of all, GPU VPS servers shares the resources on the same hosts, moreover, the GPU VPS server comes with less RAM and disk resources. Advanced dedicated GPU server A4000 should fit your request better than VPS.\nPlease let us know if you are interested or you insist to upgrade the server to GPU VPS A4000.\n  Sincerely,\n\nJonathan L\nDatabase Mart Support Department\nhttp://www.databasemart.com\n  From: Ada Struct <adastruct@gmail.com>\nSent: Tue, 25 Jun 2024 08:05:32 -0500\nTo: Database Mart LLC <support@databasemart.com>\nSubject: Upgrading to Professional GPU VPS - A4000 for the rest of the plan",

        "body": "JUNE 2024\nSlack Admin Updates\n\nRead on to prepare yourselves and your members for new capabilities, changes and deprecations.\nWHAT'S NEW\nWhat’s new or currently rolling out:\n  Channel manager invitation restrictions (Enterprise Grid)\nChannel managers can restrict members and guests from inviting others to private channels, making it so that only channel managers and admins will be able to invite users to the channel.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Integrate Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook with Slack OOO\nA new option allows members to automatically set their Slack status to “out of office” when set in Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  New channel audit report export type (Enterprise Grid, Business+)\nThe channel audit and channel membership audit is available for eligible customers to self-serve via the Exports page in Slack. This additional export type will be available to primary owners and owners. Enterprise Grid customers can also assign additional members the Export Admin system role.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Corporate email restrictions (Enterprise Grid)\nA new setting allows org owners to block members from joining external workspaces with their corporate email address.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Trigger curation for Workflow Builder admins (Enterprise Grid)\nOwners and admins can now control which triggers can be used to build workflows. This functionality mirrors the existing controls for managing Workflow Builder steps.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  New setting to require org owners to log in with SSO (Enterprise Grid)\nAny Org Owner can enable a new setting to require that all Org Owners always sign in to Slack via SSO (rather than bypassing SSO to sign in with their email address and password).\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Custom DLP messaging (Enterprise Grid)\nDLP admins have the option to set up custom text for tombstone rules and “Show a warning” rules. Text can be customized on a rule-by-rule basis.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Audit Logs dashboard enhancements (Enterprise Grid)\nThe Audit Logs dashboard has a new Security Detections tab that centralizes all anomaly audit logs so that admins and Audit Log Admins can easily filter and analyze their anomaly audit logs. The existing view Full Log Details modal will now also include anomaly “reason” definitions.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Legacy permissions migration\nSlack’s 20 existing legacy permissions will be migrating to the Account Types dashboard to streamline permissions administration.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Request to join a huddle\nWhen a member uses a huddle link to join a huddle in a conversation they don’t have access to, they can request to join.\nCOMING SOON\n  Slack lists\nLists is a new surface where teams can manage tasks, requests, issues and more in Slack.\n  Monthly active user data\nThe overview dashboard displays data showing monthly active users—the number of people who have read or sent a message in at least one channel or direct message at least once in the past 28 days within a given workspace. Enterprise Grid organizations will also be able to access this data at the org level.\n  Shared sidebar sections, powered by user groups\nA new option will allow a user group’s default channels to automatically appear as a shared section in all group members’ sidebars instead of the channels showing in the catchall “Channels” section.\n  Important changes to legacy workflows\nFollowing the release of the new version of Workflow Builder in September 2023, we announced the deprecation of the legacy version of Workflow Builder. As part of this deprecation, you will no longer be able to create legacy workflows, use legacy templates, or copy existing legacy workflows as of June 24, 2024.\nLearn more ‌ →\n  Visibility into channel canvas edits\nMembers will have the option to share canvas updates within the channel. Channel members will see a message indicating that changes have been made to the canvas.\n  Custom roles (Enterprise Grid)\nAdmins will have the ability to select from a menu of permissions, then name and assign that role to individual members or IDP groups.\nUpcoming deprecations\n  32-bit Slack desktop app for Windows\nStarting with the release of desktop app version 4.39 in June 2024, Slack will no longer release a 32-bit app for Windows. Users on version 4.38 and below can continue using the 32-bit client until their app version reaches the end of its support lifecycle.\nLearn more ‌ →\n\nEmail link to sign in on mobile functionality is retiring on July 24, 2024\nThe option to sign in on mobile with a link emailed to your device will be retired in July. Users can instead scan a QR code with their mobile device when logged in on desktop.\n\nOS, app and browser versions reaching end of support on September 1, 2024\nIn accordance with our support lifecycle policy, we have discontinued support for a number of operating systems, app versions and browsers.\nLearn more ‌ →\n\nGoogle Calendar for Team Events app will be retired on September 10, 2024\nWith the launch of a newer Google Calendar app, we will be retiring support for the legacy Google Calendar for Team Events app. The newer app offers enhanced features, including the ability to send calendar notifications to channels.\nLearn more ‌ →\n\nLegacy desktop configurations will be deprecated on September 17, 2024\nWith the introduction of a streamlined desktop app configuration, the following legacy configurations are redundant and will be deprecated.\nSlack default sign-in on all platforms. See the default sign-in file\nEnvironment-variable SLACK_NO_AUTO_UPDATES on Mac and Windows\nThe user preference SlackNoAutoUpdates on Mac. See disable automatic updates\n\n\nDesignated channels for flagged messages will be retired on September 17, 2024\nDesignated channels for flagged message review are being retired, and flagged messages will instead be reviewed from the admin dashboard. Organizations currently using a designated channel can view and take action on outstanding messages from the channel, but newly flagged messages will be sent to the dashboard.\nLearn more ‌ →\n\nFiles.upload API will be retired on March 11, 2025\nAny new applications created on or after this date will be prevented from invoking the files.upload API. Full deprecation will take place on March 11, 2025. To prepare for this change, we recommend migrating away from files.upload and instead using the combination of files.getUploadURLExternal and files.completeUploadExternal. More information on how to use these two APIs together can be found on our Uploading files documentation.\n\nUpcoming changes to legacy bots and classic apps\nBeginning on June 4, 2024, you will no longer be able to create legacy custom integration bot users or classic Slack apps.\nLearn more ‌ →\n\nHELP CENTER\n©2024 Slack Technologies, LLC, a Salesforce company.\nSalesforce Tower, 415 Mission Street, 3rd Floor,\nSan Francisco, CA 94105, United States\nslack.com\nOur Blog   |   Policies\nHelp Center   |   Slack Community\nAll rights reserved.
