The steel factory is partly run by our former PhD Anne-Marie Großmann, who is one of the 100 most influential women in the German economy (Link) and actively transitioning her company to green steel production (Link). She is a very prominent figure in the green steel transition and I am thus very proud that we are able to visit the company's factory.  Our general plan is to depart Berlin early in the morning via bus or train and be back in Berlin in the early evening, so you can enjoy your Friday evening as well. Bear in mind that our chair will organize the transportation, however, if you sign up and do not attend, we might charge you the ticket price. As seats are very limited (only 20 people incl. me can visit the factory), it is very important that you really attend if you signed up. The company visit is not relevant for the exam. Please sign up as quickly as possible starting tomorrow morning in the survey on ISIS. Best, Sokol",

Everyone that has not yet registered themselves via ISIS (also the ones that have written me e-mails), please do so now. Course registration takes place firstly and MOST IMPORTANTLY by registering via MOSES/MTS for the exam but additionally via the ISIS registration. Thus, everyone must register via MOSES/MTS and also via ISIS. If you have registered on both platforms, then you are eligible to take the course (from my side, not taking into account the rules of your program etc.). Secondly, we have two wonderful lectures tomorrow! Dr. Mona Mirtsch from the \"Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development\"  will join us for a lecture between 2.15 - 3.45pm in H0110. Then, we will have an exercise lecture by two ISO employees, Stefanie Müller joining in person and Simon Taillard (online) from the ISO sustainability unit in H 3006 from 4.15 - 5.45pm. For the exercise lecture, you will have to upload an MC question (1 question, 4 answers, of which 1-2 answers must be correct) regarding the content after the lecture (until 11.59pm the next day). Thirdly, I have uploaded a preliminary schedule for the whole semester on the ISIS front page, which may be subject to change. Please also start finding groups (you can use the classroom tomorrow, the discussion forum etc.) of 3-4 students for the standards presentations. I will announce the dates for the presentations soon (probably mid-June). Thank you and looking forward to see you again tomorrow! Best, Sokol",

Due to the visa issues, I won't be able to attend in-person lectures until June. So if lectures can be taken online up until June, I will continue the course. Or else I'll need to unenroll. Can you confirm if the course can be attended remotely? Thank you.",

Since I will probably get the visa in early June and might be available for in-person classes from mid-June. I know you have said most lectures will be in person, and I unenrolled from the course after getting the reply. However, I just enrolled again after seeing the email that I had been selected. So, is there anything I can do to continue this course remotely?",
