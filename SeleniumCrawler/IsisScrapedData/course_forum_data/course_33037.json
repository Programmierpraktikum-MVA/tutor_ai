                                    "Content": "Hi everyone, There were a few questions today at the summary lecture, please find the answers below! The MTS registration numbers should be: NAMUT: #30175v5: Methods and Tools for Sustainability Assessment - Management of Sustainable Development Schwerpunkt: #30702v4: Management of Sustainable Development In the marble example for LCSA, I looked into the paper and I am not sure why the revenue is 0 for one of the marble types. The paper states that they included labor costs, equipment costs, fuel costs, waste disposal costs, electricity costs, and revenues for the LCC. But it is not stated why one of the marble types had no revenue. In slides 13 and 14 of the summary lecture, you see the evaluation scheme for LCSA. You have the inventory data for LCA, the economic for LCC, and the social dimension for S-LCA. For the environmental LCA, you have aggregation and characterization, and can derive the impact categories like global warming and acidification. For the LCC, you have different costs (e.g., production, maintenance, external). And then for S-LCA we have human health, working conditions, equality, etc. Based on the three methods applied, you then have this three-dimensional score with social, economic, and environmental criteria. However, there are a lot of challenges aggregating several results to a single criterion score for each dimension. For the LCSA framework though this would be the ideal case that this is possible. For costs it is easier, you can just sum those up but for social impacts, it is difficult to sum up human health and working conditions. A potential solution for this could be to use an activity variable such as worker hours. Activity variables are used to reflect the share of a given activity associated with each unit process. As such, it does not represent an impact but rather an elementary flow used to compare the intensity of the processes and aggregate impact assessment results. For the pyramid on slide 65 of the summary lecture, it comes from the EU’s indicators to measure resource efficiency. The top of the pyramid is the “lead indicator” that was chosen (resource efficiency = GDP/Direct material consumption). The bottom of the pyramid represents other indicators that can be used as productivity indicators (to show how society is doing in decoupling). These productivity indicators are defined as the ratio of GDP to different types of natural resources such as materials, water or land. I have included a pdf with more details on these indicators.

                                    "Content": "Hi everyone, There was a question about the differences between CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting.   CSR and ESG have very similar topics but have different aims. ESG has a stronger focus on quantitative measures of sustainability and is often used for investors. CSR is a more general sustainability framework for the company where they integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders. Below is a quote from Gillan et al. (2021) from their paper reviewing ESG and CSR in corporate finance (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119921000092). “Before discussing the research on ESG/CSR, we first consider the terminology and its evolution. ESG is an acronym developed in a 2004 report by 20 financial institutions in response to a call from Kofi Anon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. As it implies, ESG refers to how corporations and investors integrate environmental, social and governance concerns into their business models. CSR traditionally has referred to corporations' activities with regard to being more socially responsible, to being a better corporate citizen. One difference between the two terms is that ESG includes governance explicitly and CSR includes governance issues indirectly as they relate to environmental and social considerations. Thus, ESG tends to be a more expansive terminology than CSR.” Hope this helps! Best, Lindsey",
