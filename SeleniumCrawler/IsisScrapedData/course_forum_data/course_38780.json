Each presentation should inform about your seminar paper. It would be interesting to learn about the motivation for your paper, your research question, the kind of answer you are looking for and possibly what kind of method you are likely to apply. You may also point to next steps or bring questions to which you would like to receive answers. Ideally, each presentation should not take more than five minutes, such that there is sufficient time for questions and comments. Therefore, we recommend to limit your presentation to three slides. As announced, please feel warmly invited to join us for some ice cream after the course. Do not hesitate to get in touch in case of any questions. My e-mail is missbach@mcc-berlin.net.

Therefore, I would like to encourage everybody to make the best use of the time in our seminar dedicated to feedback and discussions. Please consider advancing your outline over the week and do not hesitate to send something through e-mail well before Monday. This would really facilitate preparation. On Monday, there will be some time to work on your seminar paper, to exchange and receive feedback. On first of July, we will have Farah with us who will give a guest lecture about public acceptance and climate policy. On July 8, we will talk about academic writing and listen to the first of your short presentations. On July 15, we would like to have most of you presenting. Please also consider having a look at the data science exercise that has been uploaded here on ISIS as well as on the next course on Datacamp.

Importantly, please try to come up with a motivating/positioning statement as discussed yesterday. Please send both in one document to me through e-mail (missbach@mcc-berlin.net), ideally by Thursday, 6th of June. This gives us sufficient time to review your ideas and to prepare for next Monday. Moreover, I have uploaded some data on ISIS on households in Colombia. Download the corresponding R-script Exercise_Colombia.R and try to complete the different tasks. Do not hesitate to get in touch in case of any questions or consult the internet, if some code outcome seems not quite right. There is another course in datacamp which you might find helpful (Data Visualization with ggplot2). Please consider having a look at it. Most importantly, there is an opportunity to provide feedback on the course through ISIS. We would be happy to learn more about what you like about the course and about what could be improved. Any suggestions are welcome and submissions are anonymous. Of course, we are also happy to receive your feedback directly in class. Thank you and all the best Leonard",

If you have not done so already, I would appreciate it if you could send me your thoughts through e-mail (missbach@mcc-berlin.net) by late Sunday.

Starting in June, we will spend more time with exploring and investigating data, also in class. Having completed such courses will be helpful for that. In addition, please read the paper \"Perceived fairness and public acceptability of carbon pricing: a review of the literature\". As usual, please take notes on any point that requires clarification or that sparks your interest. Please write a short text about \"What appears to be an important question around the issues of climate policy, distributional impacts and inequality?\".
