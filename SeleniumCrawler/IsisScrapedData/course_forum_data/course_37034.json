We are going to look at the two highest scoring teams of the DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge. The assignments are as follows: Group A (Team CSIRO): ['Lion-Constantin', 'Helena', 'Truong', 'Jiaming', 'Mathieu', 'Doan', 'Paul'] (Lion-Constantin hosts) Group B (Team CERBERUS): ['Max', 'Tilman', 'Robert', 'Tobias', 'Ladislaus', 'Lewe', 'David', 'Erik'] (Max hosts) I am sorry that the papers (especially for team A) are so long, but they are pretty light on the technical side and I hope you can at least read the overview parts if you are short on time for exam preparation etc. Please remember to fill out the paper review form by end-of-the-day Wednesday.

Since there were some questions regarding the final report, here is a summary for everyone: - The due date is Oct 1st, 2024. The grades will be assigned within 2 weeks of report submission, so if you need the grade early, submit earlier accordingly. - Submission as PDF by E-Mail to me. - Length: 4 pages + references, using a scientific writing style & formatting similar to the papers we read. - It's an open topic that should be related to multi-robot systems. Examples include:    * A summary/survey of the papers we have read    * A summary/survey of a topic we haven't covered (e.g., swarm robotics or any bio-inspired methods)    * A description of an experimental study you might have done.    * A more in-depth summary/discussion of a sub-topic (e.g., literature review of just multi-robot SLAM) - The report should be written by you for the purpose of the class. - Using tools to improve your writing (including generative models) is fine, but please mention the tools you used in the report.

I decided to simply let everyone who is interested join, so we will be a pretty large group of 18 students for the discussions. I believe that this will improve the diversity of our discussions and it also means it will be less hosting work for most people. For next week I uploaded the papers and we have the following group assignments: Group A: ['Tilman', 'Mathieu', 'Helena', 'Jiaming', 'Tobias', 'Robert', 'Truong', 'Wangdong', 'Max'] Group B: ['Doan', 'Lewe', 'Lion-Constantin', 'David', 'Paul', 'Erik', 'Ladislaus', 'Felix', 'Frederik']  Where Tilman and Doan are the hosts / lead the discussion. Remember to read the paper of your group beforehand and fill out the discussion form by Wednesday midnight.  I will create a longer term host assignment next week so all future hosts will know earlier in advance.  Best, Wolfgang",
