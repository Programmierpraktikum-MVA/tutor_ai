I thought it would be prudent as a final note for the potluck to remind us all, whether we buy or make something to bring along, out of curtesy please bring a small note to put next to your dish containing information about common allergens  - e.g. contains: gluten, soy, peanuts, citrus and dairy. Though I'd recommend you bring something vegan, if it isn't vegan please indicate this too! You're welcome to bring beverages as well, but note that coffee, tea, juice, still and sparkling water, and some sekt will be provided at the graduation ceremony.  Enjoy the sunshine this afternoon, see you tomorrow! Warm wishes, Rhys",

This is a quick bit of additional housekeeping in addition to the longer checklist I sent last week. If you don’t want to show anything on the beamer/projector at next week’s final exhibition presentations, ignore this message.  If you do wish to present something on the beamer, make it fit on one slide and send it to me by Monday 08.07, at 6pm at the latest. You only have 3 minutes to present each, so you should not need more than 1 slide as next to showing your object. If you want to show any video or anything, make sure your device has an hdmi input or you bring an appropriate adapter. See you next week! Looking forward to it! Best wishes, Rhys",

We need to set up the room and you will need ample time to set up your own display for your object. Make sure to bring your object/representation of your object with you, and if it is a digital display, make sure to bring a power source. We will only have until 16:00 to go through all of your objects, so each person only has 3 minutes to present, which I will be strict in moderation. There will be 2 minutes for audience questions and feedback for each person.  Along with you object, remember to bring a printed short text (a third of a page long) which names your object + briefly goes over the most important points of how it relates to your ethical question/problem. 2) Bring vegan potluck food to snack on during our exhibition/the graduation after (homemade is preferable, but store-bought stuff like hummus and carrot sticks is also fine!) 3) Read the course manual! especially the assessment descriptions, to make sure you are up to speed with what is actually expected of you. 4) When the penpal tandem is due in August, you must hand in penpal tandem INDIVIDUALLY (whatever you completed with your partner must be handed in by EACH student, to ensure that the system has registered your submission). Include both your own full name and that of your partner on that document. 5) If you have questions about the assessment get them to me by July 12th at the latest, I will be on holiday after this and not checking my work emails. As you already know, we are combining our final exhibition with the graduation ceremony of the BEC’s first graduates. This means that our class will \"end\" at 4:00 pm and that you will have the chance to witness the certification ceremony of the graduates. After the graduation, there will be a toast and all attendees will have a moment to enjoy refreshments, chat, and peruse your exhibition – you can feel free to show off your objects and explain them to the BEC community present as you wish! You are of course free to leave at that point, however, you are cordially invited to stick around for an hour and meet the BEC/BEL (Berlin Ethics Lab) community!  Tear-down of the exhibition will take place after the event, at 6:30 pm. If you have to leave before then, we kindly ask that you leave your exhibition object, unless it is very delicate or valuable (or vital to bring with you such as a laptop), in which case please cause minimal disruption in removing it from the space, and consider beforehand if there is some disposable representation you can leave in its place (such as a print out picture of the object) so that the audience can still somewhat interact with that part of the exhibition.

We will also be joined by Masha, a new colleague who will teach this Module next semester. Though I will be waiting to welcome you in the Foyer from 13:45, there is no need to wait for me before you start exploring and taking notes. Feel free to arrive earlier and head straight upstairs to explore at your own leisure. Note: each person is responsible for getting themselves back to class - you must make sure you leave Futurium to return to PTZ around 15:30 to ensure you are back by 16:00 for the continuation of the seminar. Regarding the exhibition -  it is important that you think about your ethical question - This question should be presented very briefly in a description of the problem (similar to the small signs that are hung next to the exhibits in museums). The central thing about an exhibition is of course the \"EXHIBITION OBJECT\". So you find a way to present your ethical question/problem using a creative approach. This could be, for example, an object that you physically build and then show in the form of photos/hold up to the camera, it could be a video that you show, a small computer game, a picture, a short story, a performance (e.g. a poem recited), etc. These are primarily for showing in class during our 14:00-16:00 slot on the 10th before the BEC graduation ceremony, but you can of course show them off to peers after the speeches etc. at the graduation as well. You have about 3 minutes of presentation time in class - very short. How you use it to present your \"object\"/ \"performance\" is up to you. Perhaps you want to introduce the question, the description and the object, perhaps explain something, perhaps let the performance speak for itself... This is your exhibition. Feel free to be inspired by things you see at Futurium as well! We have had very different, exciting contributions in recent years, including images generated with self-reflection prompts AI on questions of content generation; an origami watercolor artwork on water and spatial distribution in urban planning; tests with different coding variants on the influence on automated content moderation; explanatory videos on sampling on questions of cultural appropriation; poems on self-optimization; \"the world's most depressing party game\" with a dice that stimulates positive and negative social media comments to discuss anonymity on the internet and the culture of speech; an online game in which you have to click through dilemmas; Theater, songs, cardboard artworks, comics, sound collages... It's your topic - and I'm sure you'll find a creative way to deal with it...  Further questions and concerns can be answered in the next session as well as the final Q&A on 26.06. See you on Wednesday! Best, Rhys",

Entrance is free of charge. It is important you arrive ON TIME at 14:00 so that you have sufficient time to explore the space. At 14:10 we will head inside, explore for an hour and meet up back at the entrance to give our brief impressions. After this we will take our 30 min break and individually head back to the PTZ building, meeting at 16:00 for the rest of our seminar in our usual room (the 245 bus runs between the Futurium and the PTZ building). Inside the Futurium, you will explore the exhibition spaces therein and make short notes on what you observe, reflecting on what you have seen, what you found interesting or had criticism for, etc., thinking in particular along the lines of what you have learned about transdisciplinary from the assigned reading. This will serve as a basis for discussion in the class we will continue back at the PTZ . These insights can also serve as a basis for your Commentary should you write it on the theme of transdisciplinary.  See you there! If you have any questions or issues arriving on time to this excursion, please inform me ASAP ahead of time. Best wishes, Rhys",

To those who were not in session yesterday, please be aware that our next session will BEGIN at the location of our excursion - Futurium. Entry is free. You will not be able to bring your backpacks into the exhibit, and will need to use a 50 cent or 1 euro coin to unlock the lockers in the foyer (this will be refunded when you take your things back). We will meet in the foyer at 14:00 sharp and have 1.5 hours to explore the space. Each student should pair with their tandem partner and/or form another small group to explore together. You should take notes as you look at the artifacts and writings you see in the space through analyical eye, employing the lenses provided by the readings and seminars thus far (in particular thinking of how this exhibit relates to the last reading on Trandisciplinarity). At 15:30 we will leave the Futurium and you will have half and hour to take a break and return to our usual room at PTZ 002. We will discuss in that session what we saw on the excursion and how we reflected on it, you will each be invited to sign off your name on the course participant list (important for administrative purposes), as well as discussing practicalities for the final exhibit. Have a lovely weekend! See you at Futurium on June 19th! Best wishes, Rhys",

As an optional addition, if you would like to make a head start on an Ethics commentary and/or get an even more out of the next seminar, there are some interesting additional readings included in that section as well which could be nice to have read before class.

KEEP NOTES for discussing your commentaries later in the semester and write down any questions or critiques you have about the text.  Also remember to start your PenPal tandems and start pondering on your final exhibition object - if there are any delays or issues let me know. PLEASE REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOURSELF BY 08.05.24 FOR THE EXAM VIA MTS/MOSES. ALL INFORMATION ABOUT IT IS ON ISIS.  Note on registration for BUA students: If you have problems registering via MTS/Moses, please contact the BUA office: bua@pruefungen.tu-berlin.de  See you soon and have a nice rest of the week!  Kind regards, Rhys",

Our first workshop \"Kick-off workshop on Responsibility\" will take place Wednesday, 24th April, from 2:00 pm - 6:30 pm (c.t.)! Please note this slightly later-than-usual run time is implemented to facilitate important organisational matters for the course and your assessment.  The workshop will be held in room 0002 in the PTZ (round room, left on the first floor) at Pascalstraße 8 - 9. D-10587.  two IMPORTANT points for the first session:  1) Please note that we will have one mandatory reading to prepare per seminar that will be useful to clarify the concepts we will discuss. This includes seminar one on Wednesday 24th. You can find this text (Ladd, 1991) on the ISIS page. Close reading and note-taking of this text before the seminar is recommended. We know that some of you may be unfamiliar with reading this kind of text, but not to worry, just do your best and we will explore together in class how to approach such texts effectively. 2) bring an object that you identify with/describes you as a person, something that can help others understand who you are! This will be used as part of getting to know one another in this collaborative work environment. Don't overthink it, pick whatever object feels natural to you! Finally, in case you were unaware, there is also an (optional) online info-session to help you better understand your BEC trajectory and how accreditation works tomorrow at 4:00pm-5:00pm c.t.
