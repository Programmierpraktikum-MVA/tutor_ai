It's been a dense semester, so apologies if some emails went unanswered. Please use the ISIS message system to avoid this issue. Before we start the final project, here are some important updates: The MOSES system is closed for further enrollments.  The Datacamp assignment has expired, and extensions aren't possible. Check the course ISIS page for more information. If you encounter issues with Datacamp, please be patient until your final points are updated in the coming weeks. Don’t forget to join a group. If you don’t have one, apply for random assignment in selection. All informations about the final project is already on the ISIS page. Data and group-specific tasks will be published this week. We'll hold a presentation about the final project details and answer all your questions this Friday (12.07.24). The session will be recorded. The project deadline is strictly 01.09.24. Regards, Can",
