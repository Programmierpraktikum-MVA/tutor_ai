Here are some important updates and information for the next two weeks: This Week: Two Meetings Scheduled: Thursday: Inge will offer a Zoom meeting to help you refine your project narratives. She mainly will focus on how you tell your story (don’t worry, no fundamental twists). This will be very helpful for your final presentation and can be short and focused. Inge will be available during the studio timeslot starting at 14:00 -we will share the zoom link tomorrow! Friday: Anna and I will meet with you in person at 10:00 (sharp!) for a final discussion on your projects. It is crucial for all groups to attend! Next Week: Submission Deadline: Wednesday (17. June): Submit your projects digitally by 14:00. This will give you ample time to prepare your narratives and print your drawings. Final Presentations: Thursday (18. June): The final presentations with guests will begin at 14:00. Anna and I will give a brief introduction to the studio, followed by your presentations. Presentation Schedule: Each group will have 15 minutes to present. We will allocate 15-20 minutes for feedback on each project. We aim to conclude by 18:00. Preparation: Please be in the studio by latest at noon to set up your presentation boards. Each group will have 2 boards to display drawings and a small cubus for presenting material finds. We will provide more details on Friday. Open House Landscape Architecture: Friday (19. June): The Landscape Architecture open house will be from 17:00 to 20:00. Our studio presentation is scheduled at two different moments between 17:00 to 19:00. Please make sure that you are at the university for this timeslot -we will give more information on Friday! Anna and Selina: As the studio’s representatives for the open house, we need to discuss a few organizational matters this Friday. Thank you for your support! We wish you all the best as you finalize your projects and are looking forward to seeing your presentations on Friday. Best, Anna + Alejandro",

We have the impression that you all have developed strong conceptual narratives on your sections and know them really well -hopefully the excursion gave you some interesting insights! However, there is still much work to do on the visualization of your design strategies. Please put  as much effort as you can on your drawings, it is crucial! Now we are  entering the last phase of the studio, with 4 sessions left before the final presentations on July 18th. To push forward the process, we have decided to meet two times this week. On Thursday from 14.15 to ~16.00 we planned to start with a brief recapitulation of the excursion week (feedback, impact on your projects) and will finish with an Input of Inge on water related design strategies and projects in the Netherlands. On Friday from 10.00 on we will have a desk crits session which will last probably until ~14.00.  On Friday we want to speak in depth about your graphic work. Please update your main representations with the feedback of the midterms and the inputs of the excursion, and propose 2-4 section zoom-ins/Vertiefungen. Please bring zoom-in sketches and argue why they are crucial for your design strategy, which -spatial- changes do you aim to depict on them and which practices and actors are involved.  We are very much looking forward to discuss your projects further!   Best,   Alejandro + Anna",

We are starting our excursion on Tuesday at 13.00 with a guidance in Natur-Erlebniszentrum Wanninchen. To make it on time, it is necessary to take the RE7 to Senftenberg at 9.46 (Berlin HBF, Gleis 11) to Calau and a bus from there to the Wanninchen’s visitors centre -of course if you are taking the bike, you can start biking from Calau (~15km each way). The guidance will take about 2 h and we will leave the visitor centre at ~16.00 to arrive in Großräschen at ~18.00 (taking the train in Calau at 17.15). I will be taking the train with Inge and biking from Calau -plans have changed ;)-, Inge will take the bus and walk with the other part of the group. We are very much looking forward!

Here some information on Friday’s session: We will start with the presentations at 13.00 (after lunch) and plan to end at ~16.00 with 30 min for each project. Please plan for 15 min presentation and 15 min feedback -here again we will need the support of the ‘presentation group’ to keep track of time and help organize the room to start on time. As Anna discussed with you on Friday, the presentations should be in digital formats -please feel also very welcome to present from your whiteboards (Miro, etc) or to prepare a PDF. Additionally, we expect each group to prepare a table with material finds and pin up representative process drawings on the wall. In terms of content, it is crucial to bring a title and a working thesis. Please be precise and focus on sharpening your graphic and spoken narratives. Have in mind that Prof. Inge Bobbink and Prof. Andreas Kurths will attend the midterms as well, therefore it is important to briefly introduce your sections as well.    Please let us know if you have any questions. We are very much looking forward! Best and see you on Friday,   Alejandro + Anna",

Now coming to the finances, these are the costs of the excursion:  Guidance Wanninchen: 6€ p. Person Guidance Welzow: 42.50 € p. Person Guidance Lieberroser Endmoräne: 10 € p. Person 'Spende' Floating University: 10€ p. Person  2 Nights at IBA Studierhaus (8 Beds): 52 € (the group is spending the night in 2 rooms with 2 beds each, 4 rooms in total for the students) 2 Nights at IBA Studierhaus -Garten (1 Tent): 37 €  You will get a funding of  40€ (10 €/day). So please collect the receipts (food doesn't count) -this applies also for Monday when you are visiting on your own.  So: if you are attending the full excursion you will have to come up with 120,5 € and some extra money for food. We are able to cook in the IBA Studierhaus and there are supermarkets in the area which will reduce the food costs to a minimum. If you are not taking your own bike, I wanted to let you know that there is the possibility to rent a bike on Wednesday to visit the lakes for extra 12 € close to the Studierhaus -please let me know until Thursday if you are interested, I pre-reserved 5 bikes (there are also e-bikes) and need to let them know until Wednesday (5. June) how many we are taking.  Last but not lest: For the finances of the excursion (Annika and Erwin): it would be great if you could help us calculate the money for each one of the studio participants (based on the whatsapp poll).  Maybe you can also distribute some responsibilities on the prearation of food at the IBA house.   And I see Jun (Justin?) on the Miro board on the Excursions planning group: could you support us finding out about the train and bike connections for each day? That would be extremely helpful!  We are very much looking forward to see you tomorrow!  Best,  Anna & Alejandro",

As a help and inspiration please elaborate for your project the following: *We see the Anthropogenic Practice of *XXX* (eg gridding) as a dominant force in the place. It strongly determines how the material world is terraformed: *XXX…* (> e.g., the practice XXX determines that the wetness is held as water in basins…)  * This leads our deign thesis: Under the aspect of *your 2 terms* (eg. kinship and not-yet) we are interested in how practices of Post-Anthropocene / more-than-human practices *XXX* (eg co-habitation in farming, … rewetting of…, …circular… letting go of control in…) could gain more agency / power in the place.  * The story is graphically unfolding here… (please show!)  …lets test it on Friday!   2 We will also go into methods of representation and look for their potential in your project. Please watch before the session on Friday the two following inputs *Feral Atlas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j5tx8ctMMI&t=2s *Alexandra Arenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCurvb8IDgE&t=1440s *For each input: formulate 3 aspects that help you in your project and that you will elaborate in your drawings.   3 We want to ask you to each create a station / place for your project in the studio. Consisting of a Stellwand with ýour drawings and a table with your material findings – nicely curated as your material findings tell a lot.   Let’s see where this takes you!

Each group has 10 minutes to report and there will be 10 minutes for feedback. *As Dominikus will be joining in, please be sure to clearly state what your approach is. Please do so in formulating an exploration / design thesis (working thesis) that contains at least one anthropocentric practice (with feral effects) and – as a twist – at least one practice that brings in a twist in how your place can be narrated and imagined differently. Also please have a (working) title if you dont have one yet. *The presentation group (Ekaterina, Zhixiao, Yinzhou, Lingling) will please take care of the timekeeping. We are very curious!

We will start tomorrow at 10.15 (please be on time!) with a small discussion round and the presentation of Prof. Inge Bobbink who is visiting this and coming week from TU Delft.  For the desk crits, please bring the section in real size -if you decided not to work analogue, please print it. We know of course that it's work in progress, but it would be much more fruitful to discuss on the drawings.  Best and see you tomorrow,   Anna and Alejandro",

As Prof. Inge Bobbink will do the desk crits with us on Friday, we ask you all to be on time in the studio room for a small check-in/presentation round. If you have any urgent questions, please let us know, we are happy to meet you on thursday -please let us know! ...and last but not least, the door isn't working properly -the code is still missing. Therfore, if you want to work in the studio room on Wednesday or Thursday, please send us an E-mail, or write a message in the whatsapp group.  Best and see you soon,   Anna and Alejandro",
