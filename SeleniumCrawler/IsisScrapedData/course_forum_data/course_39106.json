We will meet there on Wednesdays from 2 to 4 PM in room 209. Since the seminar mainly involves group work, online participation is only possible in exceptional cases and must be registered in advance. Introductory Session will be online (due to water damage in the TEL building) Zoom-Meeting beitreten https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/68942240617?pwd=M3k5UDliZXpGbW92MnZ3djFYRWw0UT09  Meeting-ID: 689 4224 0617 Kenncode: 365533 Topic Detecting misinformation is becoming increasingly crucial for our society. In this regard, we aim to examine the impact of political bias, which exists in individuals' political opinions and within articles through the presence of certain language and narratives. The goal is to determine whether pointing out the existence of political bias within an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) system can aid in recognizing false information. In the first two sessions of the seminar, we will cover the basics of fake news detection and political bias, as well as the fundamentals of experimental design. In the remainder of the course, we will collaboratively develop an experimental platform and conduct the experiments as a crowdsourcing study. At the end, we will collectively analyze the results. Grading In the third session (May 8, 2024), short presentations on the existing literature will be held. Subsequent sessions will focus on developing the experimental design, implementation, and execution in groups. In the last two sessions, results will be analysed and presented in a plenary setting. The grading breakdown is as follows: Literature presentation: 20% Experiment implementation and execution: 30% Results analysis and presentation: 30% Written report (4 - 6 pages): 20% Registration Please read this section carefully and in its entirety. Pay attention to the two-stage process for registration. Furthermore, the following description is exclusively for Master's students.
