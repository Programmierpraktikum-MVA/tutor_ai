That is, of course, a very reasonable position. But I was surprised by how certain some of you were about your positions, seemingly without having considered the pros in cons in detail. This is why I would like to at least present one counterargument for your consideration, still without revealing my own opinion about the matter. One central strategy of open science is open access publishing. In this publishing model, the cost of publishing is covered by the authors, whereas in the traditional model, the subscribers to journals cover this cost. For many journals, there is a significant price tag attached to publishing a paper, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 US$. This amount of money is not available to all authors. For example, authors from disciplines that are not as generously funded as computer science (think: philosophy, where people rarely have research grants) will in general not be able to afford this.  Also for authors from developing countries such sums are out of reach. So while open access publication achieves its goal of making research results for everyone, it limits access to publication channels for large parts of the scientific community. Currently, we have a mixture of open access and closed access publication. Most funding agents in \"rich\" countries require open access publications, so this works well, when the funds for open access publication are provided to researchers. But I think these publication fees are also jeopardizing effective scientific dissemination for some disciplines and some geographic regions. Always consider all sides of the argument before you make up your mind! Best, Oliver   ",
