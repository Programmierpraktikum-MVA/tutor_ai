As of now, 7 students took this project as their first choice and I see no problem that all of these students can participate. Still, I would like to offer an online meeting in order for us to get to know each other a little more and talk about the project. The meeting will be on Monday 18th of March at 10:00 using this zoom link. https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/6845346824?pwd=Z2gxUHlaZkJFOTQ4OVNlV1crbi92Zz09 If you can't make it, let me know via ISIS or email. If many people prefer a different day/time we can also shift this. Best regards, Clemens Biet",
