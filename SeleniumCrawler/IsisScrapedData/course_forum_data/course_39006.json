We proposed the Tuesday time slot (July 16th, 10:15 am - it is written on ISIS). If you cannot make it on this day, please let me know as soon as possible. Next week we are discussing the stereo depth estimation paper. This will conclude the theory part of the course. The final exam will cover Ex 6, 7 and the theory from Contrast Maximization to the stereo paper, excluding the discussion of the monocular paper EMVS. I can also ask about general things, like what is an event camera, what is a time surface representation (since we use it in Ex 7), etc. Best regards, Guillermo",

In the global_flow_estimator.cpp where the computeImageOfWarpedEvents() is called two times and two pointers of an object of type cv::Mat is passed in both places. Somehow after the function is done processing, i see that all the values in the image are zero, when i print the image in the global_flow_estimator.cpp . However, I also printed the image inside the function computeImageOfWarpedEvents() itself and not all values are zero, which means something has been done to the image as expected. This bug is weird and Unfortunately i can't find the bug after trying for some time. I also printed the address of the image in both places (inside global_flow_estimator.cpp after calling  computeImageOfWarpedEvents() and also in the function computeImageOfWarpedEvents() itself) . The address is the same, which is expected.  Has anyone else had the same issue?  best regards Hassan ",
