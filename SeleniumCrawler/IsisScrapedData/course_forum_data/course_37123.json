Caution: This is not a group task! You have to work on this task on your own. Major similarities to the work of another student can constitute plagiarism! For everyone who could not attend the seminar today: During the assignment kickoff, I presented a recap of the essay assignment as given on our initial task sheet, as well as some general hints for the task. All of the information can be found inside the slide set uploaded to ISIS. Your work on the task proper starts after the topic selection. Please carefully review the task sheet and assignment kickoff slides! Should you have any questions, you can ask me via email. Best regards, Nils Japke",
