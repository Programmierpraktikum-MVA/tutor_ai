G is given with linearly-independent rows, which means it as a right-inverse.  The equations I have come up with would be a lot easier to solve, if these were interchanged, i.e. A right-invertible, and G left-invertible.  Is this on purpose? In other words, is the point of the Exercise to find some way of inverting the matrices even though they're not invertible as such?",
