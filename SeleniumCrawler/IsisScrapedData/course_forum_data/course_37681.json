It is crucially important that to the next meeting you bring in pointed representations. In order to have enough time to elaborate those until hand-in of your thesis – it is very important that we can discuss your project based on visual representations that bring your narration to the point. they are the crucial moment in which your project becomes discussable – that is the only way we can give you truly helpful feedback. We are thus much looking forward to an inspiring session! All the best! Anna",

Each of you has a 30 min. presentation, plan therefore for 15 min. presentation and 15 min. feedback -of course in the case of 2 people projects (BA) you have more time!  We are very much looking forward to meet you next Wednesday in our chair!  Best,  Alejandro, Andreas, Anna & Edda.",
