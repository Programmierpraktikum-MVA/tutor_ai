We also will do a brief evaluation on the course, consisting of four questions (see ISIS). You can already do it now, but there will also be time next Tuesday, I just would like you to think about what has been good, what bad and which suggestions you have to improve the course. Please bring your laptop next week. If time allows I will give a presentation on neo-colonialism and nature conservation (ca. 45 min). Your last task will be a kind of reflection of the entire course by thinking about four main take-home messages  (see screenshot). Deadline: 28.7. Wish you a good remaining week, see you on Tuesday, Stefan Heiland",

You will find this \"Registration form\" in the first section on ISIS, with the relevant information (now in red - hardly to overlook) above it. Once again: Self-enrolment on the ISIS course is not sufficient. For the list of participating students, I will only consider those who have registered for the course. There will be no exceptions, there has been more than enough information on that from different sides. If you have not yet done so, please fill in the registration form by this Sunday, 7 April at the latest. I also have to add that the course is offered to Bachelor \"ÖKUP\" students in the \"Profilierungsphase\" that starts at 5th or 6th semester. Therefore I can't accept Bachelor students 2nd and 4th semester. Sorry for that. You will find the preliminary list of participants on the ISIS website by 12 April, but probably much earlier (next Monday or Tuesday). Best regards, have a nice weekend, Stefan Heiland",
