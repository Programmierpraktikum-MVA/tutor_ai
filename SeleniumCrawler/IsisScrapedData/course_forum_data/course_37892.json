Each student must participate in at least one of the two dates. Please let us know on which of the two dates you would like to present. If you can present at either, please let us know as this would facilitate the creation of the exact presentation schedule. Of course, you can participate in both events, one as speaker and the other one as part of the audience. If you decide not to take part in the seminar, please let us know, as this would facilitate our work. Moreover, not every student has yet informed me about their matriculate number. Please do so. Additionally, I kindly ask you to tell me whether you are taking the seminar as a standalone, or as an elective for another module (please share the module name).   Best regards, Dennis Grinwald",
