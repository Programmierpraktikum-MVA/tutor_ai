You will have 10 minutes to present your work and we'll have about 5 minutes for questions. Please practice your presentation and make sure that you stick to 10 minutes. The deadline for uploading your pipeline's ethograms is Wednesday the 17th of July. You can upload them using the following link: https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/ectfBkDJJHS4zqp QAB-ethograms-2024  As mentioned during the tutorial, I added some plotting code on ISIS which you can use to plot tracks in 2D on top of a video (for example, your 3D Kalman-filtered reconstruction of the scene, reprojected into one of the camera views. Feel free to use it, or add stuff, such as an indicator for frame-per-frame interaction detections.  Best, Mark",

There will be two deliverables: the ethograms generated by your pipeline, and the report. Furthermore, you will present your work on the 19th of July. All three are necessary requirements for the course.  Ethograms (deadline 17.07): Please save the ethograms generated by your pipeline for the two experiments in two separate npz files as numpy arrays (you can use the function numpy.savez for this). The (2-dimensional) numpy arrays should have the following shape: [nr of lockbox mechanisms (order: lever, stick, ball, door), nr of frames]. The encoding of interactions is binary (for example, if the mouse is interacting with the ball in frame 10, then the array should contain a 1 for that particular index). Please name the files as follows: [experiment number]_[last names of students].npz. You can upload the files using the following link & password: https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/ectfBkDJJHS4zqp QAB-ethograms-2024 Presentation (19.07): During the last lecture of the semester, you will present your work. In your presentation I expect you to give a short overview of the methods you applied, the additional behavioral analysis that you performed, future work ideas, and your learnings & struggles during the project. Since some students only audit the course, I do not have an exact overview of who is taking the course for credits. Please fill in the short ‘Presentation schedule’ questionnaire on the ISIS page by this Friday, 05.07, so that I know how many presentations will take place on the 19th. Based on that, I will inform you about the maximum length of your presentations. Report (deadline 16.08): In your report, you should provide a more detailed description of your pipeline. The report should have a standard scientific format, including an introduction, methods section, results, discussion, and references. The report should be about 10 pages long (if you have many figures, it will be a bit longer). Please add your code to the report either as an appendix or share your git repository with me. Please mail me your report by Friday the 16th of August. The ‘labeled-data’ folder for your DLC project is part of the deliverable for the report (see my earlier announcement). Please don’t forget to upload it (as a zip file) using the following link: https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/7ExLwGZWRTSrJkC TkyhrwIxL&c0hqa   Best, Mark",

Many groups struggle to train a decent tracker with the available resources. I therefore decided to provide you with tracks so that you can continue with the rest of the project. I understand that some groups might have already spent a lot of time on labeling, debugging, and trying to get the tracker to work, while others might just be starting up with the project. To make sure that everyone went through the process of generating their own training data and thought about the necessary design choices for this step of the pipeline, please upload your ‘labeled-data’ folder from your DLC project to the TUBcloud using the following link & password: https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/7ExLwGZWRTSrJkC TkyhrwIxL&c0hqa Please upload the data as a zip file and include your last names in the name of the zip file.

Even though this talk will take place on Zoom, I would kindly like to ask you to attend the lecture at 2.057 in person. I put the preprint of his recent work on ISIS, which you can read as preparation. Best, Mark ///// Abstract: Animals generate a vast array of behaviors by composing together a small set of stereotyped actions. By classifying these action motifs (or “syllables”) and identifying their occurrence in behavioral recordings, researchers can better understand the complex ways that behavior is altered by drugs, genes, neurons, and environmental affordances. Over last few years, keypoint tracking has emerged as a powerful method to measure animal pose over time, and there are now several methods for unsupervised segmentation of animal behavior using keypoints as inputs. In this talk, I will discuss landscape of such methods: their strengths, weaknesses, and core assumptions – with special focus on keypoint-MoSeq, which was developed in our lab. My goal is to provide a conceptual overview of the field, clarifying when these methods are (and are not) useful and how they can best be applied.",

This workshop will be given in an inverted classroom style, which will consist of an interactive session working with the DeepLabCut software (you will need to bring you laptop; no need to install anything). There is some homework that you will need to do to prepare yourself for the workshop: Introduction to Computer Vision and DeepLabCut, Prof. A. Mathis (EPFL) (Optional) Multianimal pose tracking with DeepLabCut, Prof. A. Mathis (EPFL) Please watch the video(s) before the workshop! Since we will have an interactive session, the workshop will take place in room 2.013 instead of room 2.057. Best, Mark",

The videos for experiment 1 were originally longer (with a length of 13m26s), but I cut them since the trial ends directly after the mouse is eating the reward. The ethograms were still in the old format. I now cut the ethograms to 16650 frames (9m15s) and reuploaded them. You can either use the new ethograms, or compare your pipeline's results with the ethograms up to frame 16650. Sorry for the confusion.",

As far as I understand, deeplabcut needs cuda 11.8 to run. The problem Is that it was not possible to get cuda 11.8 running, because always some dependencies or packages are broken. I removed my ubuntu several times and tried different ways to install it but it never worked. Currently the only way to use it is with CPU, which is too slow to get work down. Using Google Colab was also not very helpful as I only got to train once and afterwards I am not allowed to use the GPU anymore.  - Ben",
