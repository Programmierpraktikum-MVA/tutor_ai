We don´t quite know when we will be back so we will do it without time slots.  The facade input will be on the 20th.  This week let us talk about your \"focus and detail area\". This can be interior or an intervention with the existing structure. How is this or that detail representative for your schematic design and architectural intention? Bring a first graphic and frame of what you want to focus.  We also want to recap with you the feedback you have received and sketch out a strategy how to integrate it. How to increase the level of integration of your design? How can you complement your neighbors within the hall? Important: Please find here the link to a miroboard which we will use to organize the daytrip and the exhibition. Please fill in your names quickly in the list. So we know how many people will join to make reservations etc. and book a tour.  https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/RGFQb2M4ZFZuZ0QzTXhVT3RKemRXTFZKdHNaeGFYV21vamUwaHdBTTg4ZHdyZnZFNXVNdkVEMGRpQjVGbW9YR3wzNDU4NzY0NTQ0NTE4NDg5NzMzfDI=?share_link_id=267016839132 looking forward Miryam and Philip",

We will have a look on it on Thursday.  https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/BwPaAfiFAPDC7mS For our gathering this Thursday we suggest 5:30pm at the beergarden Zollpackhof. It is central, by the water and outside so we can enjoy the nice wheater.  Food is not so great but overall convenience wins here. https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ubf97JYKYrTvxezh7 We are looking forward to your analysis and ideas about what to produce. kind regards Miry and Philip  M.Sc.

Each group is presenting for about 10 min their topic. Then we will have for about 5 - 10 min for questions and comments. Your aim is to get across how your topic might effect the schematic design. It is all about overviews. What are the key components?  deliverables  Digital presentation with your own computer device via projector. Upload poster as pdf. Print out A1. (portrait format, one or two posters)  The model group does not need a presentation or poster although they can show the files they used and highlight certain measurements.  Within your \"planning basis for students\" cloud folder is now an \"upload folder\". You can upload and edit files in this folder. After the presentation we will sort the files in the fixed file structure. You will find there a folder called \"analysis inspiration\". This is from another studio. Just as a little inspiration for graphics and scope. Also there is a \"pictures site visit\" folder. You may upload your pictures so we have a pool for us all. https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/2EnLPi4djKdmRjR More information regarding our social happening and workshop courses will follow : ) We are looking forward to your analysis Best Miry and Philip M.Sc.
