Please prepare a presentation in which you detail the requirements for your business model, basing it off of the criteria and benchmark you developed for this week.  Since you have presented most of the background already, it should be a shorter presentation (around 15-20 minutes). Furthermore, please remember to upload your group's presentation from today in the ISIS course (it's enough for one of the group's members to upload it). Thank you and see you next week! Best, Maxim Mintchev and Valentin Eingartner",
