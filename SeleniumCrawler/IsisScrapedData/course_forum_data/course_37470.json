I did try this both ways and it unfortunately still throws the error even with all of the phy initialisation at the beginning of the same loop that creates packets.  If it helps identifying the cause the full error using a regular for loop over the SNRs is:  Error using LoRaPHY/decode (line 663) Invalid header checksum!  Error in lora_per_sim (line 117) [rxPSDU, checksum, is_checksum_correct] = phy.decode(symbols_d);  It crashes after 65 simulation runs. Since I start with SF 12 (decrementing each run) and increase the SNR each run (-35 to -8), that is exactly after SF10, SNR -27.  Using parfor I get:  Error using LoRaPHY/decode (line 663) Invalid header checksum!  Error in lora_per_sim (line 64)     parfor isnr = 1:numSNR  This time it crashes after 74 runs. With parfor I again start with SF 12 but decrease the SNR each run (-8 to -35) so it stops exactly after SF 10, SNR -25.  If no one else has the same errors, I will ask again during next week's lab.

I don't know yet why this produces a bad input for the decode function. But I was able to simulate all SF/SNR combinations without the error by shifting the substream index. If you want to try it yourself, I changed line number 73 in the original lora_per_sim.m to  stream.substream = isnr + 1337;  inside the two for loops. I don't know if this will be accepted in the grading process, but it shouldn't matter.  Best regards Daniel",

At the end you should get 1000 throughput values per number of nodes, if you keep the default calculation interval. In last week's Q&A session we decided that each box needs to have at least 100 data points. This results in storing the throughput every second. Hope this helps.  Best, Christos",
