In detail, it is about exploring the human perspective on a problem in the classification of facial features. We explore further how human and Generative AI generated Counterfactual Explanations differ. The duration is 8-10 minutes. We are happy if you take your time and participate. The study is to be carried out on a laptop or PC, not a mobile device. Link to the study:  http://visualcounterfactualsstudy.info  Many thanks and best regards! Group 8",
