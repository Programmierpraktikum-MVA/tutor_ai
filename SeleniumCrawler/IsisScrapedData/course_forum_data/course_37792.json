All project slots have been filled and we have sent notifications to accepted students (quick reminder to check your inboxes: if you have forwarding from your university email to your private email enabled, check your spam folder). Unfortunately, we could not offer all students a project spot. If you have not received an email yet, we were unable to accommodate you. Best regards, Tobias Pfandzelter",
