For the start, that is not a big problem, but rendering greek letters and mathematical formatting in plots is not possible without LaTeX. Hence, it is strongly recommended to install and connect a LaTeX environment. In task 3, the mathematical description/ documentation of the code shall be in the documentation PDF. One of the reasons is the typesetting for the formulas, anothe reason is to establish the format for the documentation by means of that simple example-  Finally, I kindly request two things: For this kind of questions, please use the discussion forum. Then, my answer will be directly visible to everybody which usually helps to avoid misunderstandings, gives new insights or progress with the code quality. Also, please make use of the possibility to discuss across groups. In case you send me an e-mail, please explicitly state the course (MLCM), as I am involved in three modules this semester and there are broad similarities within some codes or topics.  Best, Stefan",
