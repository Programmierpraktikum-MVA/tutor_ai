The goal of tomorrow's exercise session is to explain the homework process (i.a., submission and presentation), introduce the spatial data structures (Octree and KDTree), and most importantly, let you form homework groups (consisting of three students). Don't worry if you are not able to attend the exercise session: the slides containing all the information will be uploaded to ISIS and there is a forum that you can use to form groups.

The reason for that is that the basis functions have a function value of zero at both boundaries of the interval, except for the first and last basis function that have a function value of one on the lower and upper boundary value, respectively. But here, all other basis functions that support the first and last knot have a function value of 0 again. Thus, they still form a partition of unity, and it is not important whether the upper boundary is contained in its supported interval or not.",

                                    "Content": "Ok thanks! I have another question regarding B-Splines. Im a bit confused on what the domain of the basis functions should be. In the lecture, I believe it was said, that t usually is in the interval of [0, 1], but that would give weird basis functions, that are not continuous at all. On the lecture slides introducing these basis functions for B-Splines, there is written: t = (t_0, ..., t_n, t_{n+1}, ...), that t is the whole vector of the knots. But plugging in a vector for t into N_i^r(t) would produce a vector valued result of N, except at N_i^0, which produces only a scalar value. That doesn't seem right either! (for N to produce sometimes a vector and sometimes a scalar value depending on r) What is the domain of the B-Spline basis functions?",
