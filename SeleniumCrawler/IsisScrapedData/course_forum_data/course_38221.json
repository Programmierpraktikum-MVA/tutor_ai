I expect most of you to attend, so that we can have a nice and active atmosphere. Moreover, as most of the topics build on each other, it is highly suggested that you attend your colleagues' talks, to improve both your own future presentation, and your understanding of the broad topic of the seminar.  Indeed, even for more separated topics, you will gain general knowledge and heuristics that will be very useful.  See you there, Alexander Zass",
