I have updated the course schedule accordingly. See details on the updated course webpage on ISIS. 3) Please also double check the entries on ISIS for your seminar presentations. A few slots are still available. See you on Monday Mark Gessner",

This is the alternative date, one week later then originally envisaged. Those of you signed up for Inland Water Ecology B, please note the change. 2) The Inland Water Ecology lectures will take place on Mondays, from 12:15 to 13:45 H in BH-N 812 as originally planned. For those of you unable to attend during this time on Mondays, I will upload the recorded lectures from last year. However, for maximum benefit, I strongly recommend attending this year's lecture in person if you can.  Also note that there will be three online lectures, on 6 May, 13 May and 3 June, as also indicated in the Course Schedule on ISIS. Please use this zoom link to connect on all three dates: https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/meeting/u5Mld-yqrj8qGNSaSCBriH6g14n_eKZNIVun/ics?icsToken=98tyKu-vpjsvGNSRsBuHR_MEGoigZ-rziClfjY1unSzGITJaSlXxZ7ZMDbdUKvb5 Meeting ID: 678 0520 4020 Passcode: 463857 Best regards Mark Gessner",

Please select a paper as soon as possible but no later than 6 May and inform me about your choice, preferably after the lecture on Monday. Please pick a topic from the uploaded list, even if the presentation dates do not suit you. We will then try to find an alternative solution. Recall that giving a seminar presentation is mandatory to be eligible for the field course on Lake Stechlin in August (i.e. Inland Water Ecology B).  If time slots are available, participants of Inland Water Ecology A may also give a presentation. Please approach me if you are interested. Since the lecture on 3 June will be online, the seminar presentation will also have to be given via zoom on that day. All other seminars will be given in person. I look forward to hearing which topics are of interest to you. Best regards Mark Gessner",

In case you havn't seen it, here is a short description of what to expect: The course involves theoretical and practical teaching units on the ecology of standing and flowing inland waters. Lectures, student seminars and exercises are supposed to lay the theoretical foundations during weekly two-hour sessions throughout the summer term. A complementary one-week block course in July/August will provide hands-on field and laboratory experience. Introductory lectures will cover lake and stream morphogenesis and morphology; hydrology; other physical features such as mixing, heat budgets, flow and light conditions; chemical characteristics; biogeochemical cycles, particularly of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; dynamics of other important chemical factors such as oxygen; features of key organisms in fresh waters; the structure of planktonic and benthic communities, including the main components of the microbial loop; interactions between organisms; food webs; ecosystem processes; ecosystem responses to anthropogenic stressors, and ecosystem assessment. Student seminars will enhance the content of the lectures.  All lectures will be identical for participants of Inland Water Ecology A and B. They are currently scheduled on Mondays from 12:15 to 13:45 p.m. However, the time may be moved if participants so wish, for example to 10:15-11:45 a.m. on Mondays. If you are unavailable between 12 a.m. and 2 p.m. but would like to attend between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m., speak up during the first lecture or send me an email beforehand, so that we can explore alternatives.    The one-week field part is currently scheduled from 29 July to 2 August on Lake Stechlin 80 km north of Berlin. Alternatively, it could take place one week later (5-9 August). Accommodation will be provided at modest cost. The field part will involve in-situ measurements and sampling in contrasting lakes or an experimental facility deployed in the lake, followed by chemical and biological analyses of the samples in the lab, data analyses, and oral presentations and discussions of the data. Prerequisites for participation, which is limited to 15 students, are attendance of the lectures and presentation of a seminar. There are no exams if you choose to attend the lectures only (i.e. Inland Water Ecology A). Note, however, that actual attendance is necessary to receive credit points.   Details of the course organization will be given during the first lecture on 15 April 2023 at 12.15 H, in seminar room BH-N 812 (Ernst Reuter-Platz 1, 8th floor).  I look forward to seeing you then.
