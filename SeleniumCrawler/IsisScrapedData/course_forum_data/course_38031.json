And it seems that we will have a comparable situation today. These figures you can nicely see online here: https://www.energy-charts.info/charts/consumption_advice/chart.htm?l=de&c=DE&datetimepicker=09.05.2024 You can imagine that exchange prices fell and became even negative as we had just too much electricity in the grid, see here: https://www.energy-charts.info/charts/price_spot_market/chart.htm?l=de&c=DE The webpage Netztransparenz also publishes the necessary Redispatch data, you can find here: https://www.netztransparenz.de/de-de/Systemdienstleistungen/Betriebsf%C3%BChrung/Redispatch  On these days you can understand how a 100% renewable energy system works quite good and what challenges still need to be solved. We need more flexibility in our system and flexible markets! Some of these issues are discussed in the lectures energy market and flexibility. I hope these real life data motivates you to go deeper into these topics. Best Fabian",

It says \"Run the scenarios simplified: Compare the average LCOE with the optimal PV-battery-Diesel hybrid System and with the Diesel only system\" that is why I was wondering.  Thank you very much, Thilo",
