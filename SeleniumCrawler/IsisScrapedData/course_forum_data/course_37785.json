We also introduced the flash presentations, the group presentations, and the discussion rounds just this semester. Therefore, we have never received feedback on these ideas, and on the course in general. Thus: please take a few minutes to participate in the anonymous course evaluation! This is really by far the best way for us to improve!  Survey link: https://befragung.tu-berlin.de/evasys/online.php?p=3HZTL  Thank you! Saeed and Johannes",

If we don't have your slides because you presented from a browser, could you please convert them to PDF and send them? If you don't agree that we put your slides online, that's completely fine as well. Please notify us in this case. Best regards, Johannes",
