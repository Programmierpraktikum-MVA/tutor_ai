Instead please take a few minutes to fill in the evaluation form: https://befragung.tu-berlin.de/evasys/online.php?pswd=5EQE9. This is really important to us! So please give us your thoughts and opininions. 3. The lecture and student presentations on June 24 will take place at the WZB again, in room B001. Thus, there will be two sessions on that day, one from 10.15 to 11.45 for the presentations and one from 12.15 to 1.45 pm. Everybody should attend the presentations if possible. All the best and see you on June 24! Dorothea",
