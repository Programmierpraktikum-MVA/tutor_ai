Our first C2X lab session will take place on 16th May 2024 at 12:00 in HFT-TA 101. To make sure everyone is up-to-date with how the lab works, here is a quick summary: You need to pass the labs to be able to take the exam. To pass the labs, out of four mandatory submission exercises two need to be passed. The deadline for submission will be mentioned in the sheets. To submit the solutions for the assignments you can work in a group of up to 4 students. There will be more than four sheets, not all entail a submission, but are preparing for following assignments. Some sheets require more work - so the sheets will not be always released weekly. We will announce new exercise sheets on ISIS. We will be reachable via ISIS for any questions you have. In addition, there will be weekly meetings. We encourage you to use the Discussion Forum on ISIS as much as possible. This will allow us to know, if you are facing any particular problem, and we will reply to it as fast as possible. The Group selection is already available on ISIS. Please select a group until 8th May 2024. The initial instructions for installing the simulation environment are online on ISIS. Please prepare the environment before our first lab session.

What kind of speeds are you seeing? In roughly an hour into the simulation I'm at like 6 (simulated) seconds. I increased the CPU and RAM allocated to the VM to no avail. Thanks, Martin",
