I was just told it can still be filled here even though the deadline was June 29] As discussed in class, these are some guidelines for what I could ask, or I won't ask in the exam on August 1st: You do not need to memorize the proofs, as I won't ask to reproduce them. You should know the statements of theorems, facts, lemmas, definitions, etc. including relevant statements or properties and its usage, that are not in a box in the lecture notes, such as Example 2.4, Remark 4.1, equation (4.5) or what does the online-to-batch conversion imply, but not how to prove them. So I may ask you for definitions and to state some properties in these statements (whether FTL works in OL for linear Lipschitz losses, what property does the gradient of a Legendre function have, examples of cases in which we may want to use use looser losses (i.e. Remark 4.1) in OL and why, etc.) I may ask questions about the big picture that test your understanding on the material. I may give you a part of a proof that we saw or one we didn't see whose steps use the material and I may ask to justify why the steps hold. Such as when I write \"why?\" in the notes. I may ask for proving some things we didn't cover, similar to what the exercises ask in the lecture notes (I won't ask things as in the problems (note there is problems and exercises) and neither long exercises), including for the sections that do not have exercises.",

If that is the case for you, please use the feedback form linked in the course description. Also, it is a good opportunity to give any general feedback you may want to share. Best, David",

I also added a set of references that contain most of the results that will be presented in the course, and references to delve deeper on the topic.",
