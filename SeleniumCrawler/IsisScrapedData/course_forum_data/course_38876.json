I feel, that critically engaging with (German) state violence, especially as manifested through space and architecture is an important theme to include in architectural practice and thinking  As for the coming weeks:  Friday, May 3, we will have a Pin-Up. Here we will use the session to see where everyone stands and how we could proceed within the frame of the semester.  Friday, June 7, we will have only a short meeting, where I will give a little input.  Friday, June 14, we will have guests from Blind-Spots (https://blindspots.support/) and probably from Grupa Granica (https://grupagranica.org/) and Rosa (https://www.rolling-safespace.org/ueber-rosa-e-v/) as well. We will use this session to hear from them and their work, and have a shared discussion.  Friday, June 21, is still open. We either have a discussion-session with a little input by me or we will have guests again, but this is still a bit unclear.  Thursday, June 27, Forensis (the Berlin Office of Forensic Architecture https://counter-investigations.org/) will hold a POSITIONEN lecture at 19:00.  Friday, June 28, we will have another Pin-Up. I am in discussion with Forensis and I hope they will be able to join us in the Seminar on Friday as well for some additional Input/Discussion with us. This is not sure yet, but I hope we will make it work.  Friday, July 5, we will visit the former Forced Labour Camp in Niederschöneweide (https://www.ns-zwangsarbeit.de/home/). This was built by German Architect Hans Freese, who also built the Kunsthaus Dahlem, was on Hitler's Gottbegnadeten Liste (\"god-gifted-list\") and therefore under special protection, but still could be Rector/Headmaster of TU Berlin from 1949 to 1950. So a visit that has multiple layers to it.  Friday, July 12, I am planning to have our final presentation and discussion. This is still open to change, it would be great if everyone could check their respective schedules and see if the 12th is a good date. For me it would also be possible to have our final presentation somewhen between July 15 and 17.  We will discuss this schedule anyway on friday, I just wanted to let you know in advance.  See you on Friday, thank you and best,  Leander",

We will meet there at 15:00, the trip takes 50m by car and 1h30m by train from Zoo. It will be a bit of a journey, but I think very worthwhile, didn't we also already talk about distance as means of border? I think we should not be discouraged by the length of the trip. So I am looking forward to see as many of you as possible there. As for the next weeks: I would like to make a pin-up of your status quo on the 31st of Mai, so in two week. Please collect your research, loose ends, fragments, questions, comments and print them out, so we can hang them up and have a look all together.  I would also like to ask you to think a bit of the format and media you would like to use for our final discussion as well as the Jahresausstellung. This helps me to plan accordingly.
