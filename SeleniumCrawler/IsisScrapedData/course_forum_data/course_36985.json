As I think it might be good to clarify your questions on this before you submit your draft concept I suggest to postpone the deadline to Tuesday afternoon. Moreover, I will join the course next Monday to be able to clarify questions directly.  Overall the concept shall be the plan for your group of how you want to structure the session/workshop you have chosen and some first thoughts also on the input presentation that you plan to give. So, see it as a first step in getting started to think about it in your group and to start making a plan/a concept. On that basis I will be able to provide feedback and support your further work on it.  I hope this helps, even it is late now. Best regards, Gesa",

I would like to inform you that this semester there will be a researcher - Vera Spangler - following our Methods of IA course for her PhD work. I attach an information letter (which is also uploaded on ISIS) and more info about Vera Spangler below. She will introduce herself and her resaerch in person in one of the coming classes. We have decided amongst the Master EP staff and faculty that we find her research very relevant and that we want to support her by allowing her to join our classes and observe them. She will keep this anonymous in her Phd, so it will not be diclosed, which program she participated in for her research and of course no individual or personal information will be disclosed. Please have a look at the information sheet which details this and provides information also about data protection etc. I hope you will be ok having her in our class. With best regards, Gesa ------ Vera Spangler is a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey, UK. Her project is a cross-national study between the UK, Denmark, and Germany and is anchored in ethnographic fieldwork and different qualitative methods. Vera will spend time in Berlin following your programme as part of her study between April - July. The main focus of her project is on international students studying a masterís degree in a place other than their home country. Vera wishes to explore the production of knowledge in different higher education settings, including everyday practices and interactions in classrooms, on campus but also other social sites. She wishes to observe what happens in an ëinternational classroomí when lecturers and students from places meet and learn together. Here, Vera is interested to learn about what knowledges international students bring with them, what knowledges they may receive, and how (new) knowledge is produced through encounters between students and lecturers. Vera will introduce herself when she arrives in April but if you're interested to find out more about her project already, you can find some more details in the information sheets attached. You are also welcome to write her an email (v.spangler@surrey.ac.uk) if you have any questions.",
