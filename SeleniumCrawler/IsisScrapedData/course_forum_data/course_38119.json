So that you can discuss it in class. Please read it and prepare your questions and feedback.  https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=38119#section-14 Prof. Wekel will go through the reflection papers with you on Friday, so please remember to finish and submit them before the deadline on the 11th of July at 23:59. The submission of the paper is important to pass the course.  The three students assigned the Lecture of Prof. Angela Million - Educative Spaced and Education for Sustainability for their reflection paper, if facing difficulties remembering the lecture's content, feel free to choose any other lecture. Unfortunately, we have not received the lecture materials from Prof. Million yet. Sorry for the inconvenience!  Best, BuSu team",
