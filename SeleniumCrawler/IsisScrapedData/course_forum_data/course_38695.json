However, I confused Steinitz with Emanuel Lasker, who also was a chess world champion. In fact, I confused Wilhelm Steinitz (the chess champion) with Ernst Steinitz, a mathematician who made important contributions to abstract algebra.  Emmy Noether generalized Lasker's theorem to any noetherian rings.",
