I wish you all interesting research, smooth note-taking and writing, and a good summer semester. I have one final request: Some of you have already registered on Moses, thank you. For the remaining of you, please also register. I was informed that we need these numbers for reporting. You can register it as \"Zusatzmodul\".  If you DO NOT want it to appear on your final diploma, you can write a short request to your examination office team (for IMES students, this is team 5). - ib5@pruefungen.tu-berlin.de https://moseskonto.tu-berlin.de/moses/modultransfersystem/modulpruefung/anmeldungwizard.html?bolognamodul=7357  Thank you very much!
