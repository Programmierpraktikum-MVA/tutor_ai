The steel factory is partly run by our former PhD Anne-Marie Großmann, who is one of the 100 most influential women in the German economy (Link) and actively transitioning her company to green steel production (Link). She is a very prominent figure in the green steel transition and I am thus very proud that we are able to visit the company's factory. Our general plan is to depart Berlin early in the morning via bus or train and be back in Berlin in the early evening, so you can enjoy your Friday evening as well. Bear in mind that the Chair of Innovation Economics will organize the transportation and cover the travel costs. As seats are very limited (only 20 people incl. me can visit the factory), it is very important that you really attend if you signed up. If you’re interested, please write an email to Julia Gräfe (julia.graefe@tu-berlin.de). Best regards, Sokol Tominaj",

I have some ideas which topic could be interesting, especially if you have also taken the course: IPM in the last semester (would also be open to other topics): 34. What are the legal and licensing requirements for formal standards that relate to FOSS? Are there certain preconditions that are needed to be able to implement a formal standard in open source? What about SEPs (standard essential patents)? Also review the (F)RAND vs Royalty Free debate, and how it relates to the four freedoms of software. 24. How do businesses involved in FOSS activities value patent assets? Do businesses with FOSS activities apply for or acquire patents? What is their patent management strategy? How are the patents used? 18. The individual motivation to contribute to FOSS without direct monetary remuneration: Ever wondered why contributors spend their time on FOSS? Write a paper about it! 10. The cost structure of FOSS communities and the corresponding funding sources: Describe the cost structure of FOSS communities or foundationss and how the communities are raising funds to cover these costs. This could be a case study about one ore multiple communities. Many communities publish their annual statements of accounts, which can be used as a starting point for research.",

There is a limitation to 30 participants. You will receive an email with a confirmation on 22 April if you have been accepted into the course.  I suppose these dates are now shifted to 22-28th of April regarding the filling of the registration form and possibly 29th of April for the acceptance email, so the definitive source regarding this detail is what is stated at the first page of the ISIS course, am I correct?  Thank you in advance for your reply.  Cheers George",
