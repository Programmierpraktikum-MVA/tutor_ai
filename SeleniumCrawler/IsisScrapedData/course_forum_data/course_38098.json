The assignemnts look the following: - Data Augmentation: Jan & Felix - Semi-Supervised Learning: Erik & Hung Bui - Self-Supervised Learning: Konrad & Maximilian - Modern CNNs & Transformer: Cedric & Johannes - Memorization & Generalization: Gunnar & Siyu Xiao - Special Aspects of Learning: Florian & Achim It nicely fit such that no one needs to work alone. I would propose the following new schedule, since 3 topics were not selected: - 22.05 Data Augmentation - 29.05 Semi-Supervised Learning - 05.06 Self-Supervised Learning - 12.06 Modern CNNs vs. Vision Transformer - 19.06 Memorization and Generalization - 26.06 Special Aspects of Learning - 03.07 Optional: Texture Bias (either presented by me if the students are interested to hear more about this topic / or assigned to students that missed the deadline) - 17.07 no class (or backup) I hope you are all fine with this. Please let me know, if you are not okay with this change of the schedule.  Best, Tom",
