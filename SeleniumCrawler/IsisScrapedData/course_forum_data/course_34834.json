For example, plant biomass can capture more CO2 than pyrolyzed biochar, but decomposes faster so that releases CO2 easily. Do the criteria differentiate the stability of each technology?\" Answer: The criteria themselves do not differentiate the stability of the technology but the standards set timeframes for how long the storage should last. These time frames depend on the specific technology and the standard. Generally, there is the agreement that each technology should store the carbon for at least 100 years (I added that on the slides), but this is not the case for every project.",

The Schwerpunkt exam needs to be done as one exam, after you completed both courses. The registration for MTS can be done in both semesters, so you can already register for the Schwerpunkt there even if you will do the exam next semester.  For further questions on this topic, please reply here.",
