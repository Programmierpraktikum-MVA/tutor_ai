Apologies for the continual changes, but there was a shortage for this timeframe, so I am taking whichever nicer rooms happen to come available. Please have a look at the Hartman text, as well as the City as an Archive text if you have time. Also, I would be very grateful if you could fill out the course evaluation if possible. It is really helpful for my development as a seminar leader; the link is located here: https://befragung.tu-berlin.de/evasys/online.php?p=HLJP9. Thank you in advance for your feedback!  I look forward to seeing you tomorrow for our last official seminar. I will, however, keep our time slot free on July 18th from 10-12. I will be in my office in FH 824 in case you would like to come by and discuss your essay or if you have other questions during this time.  All best wishes, Christy ",

I would also like to return to the Roy text briefly next week, as we did not have time to discuss that last week.  I wish you a good start in the week and look forward to seeing you all on Thursday!

I think we should try this and, unless it is forecast to rain, we will meet here on Thursday and see how it works having the session outdoors. If you have a blanket, you might want to bring it along. If it is scheduled to rain, I will send an email late Wed eve or early Thursday and we can revert to the windowless classroom. All best wishes, and I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.
