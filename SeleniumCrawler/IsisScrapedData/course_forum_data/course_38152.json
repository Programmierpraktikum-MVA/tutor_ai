Once you have completed the survey titled \"Survey: Level of confidence (before the course)\", this designation gives you access to the preparation material. In order to earn portfolio points, please go through it and submit at least one question that you still have after reviewing it. The material provides a concise overview of Fourier transformation before delving into the subjects of electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and structural modeling. Please be advised that we are currently finalising the structural modelling part. Once this is complete, we will share it with you. Best regards,  Christian",
