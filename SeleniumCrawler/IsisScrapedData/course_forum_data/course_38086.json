Please pay attention to the MTS deadlines (sign up until 31.08.2024). If you are still planning to do the exam according to the old StuPO, please let us know.   Information for the examinations: At the beginning, the examinee independently presents a freely chosen topic from the scope of the lecture (duration 5 minutes, freely spoken, no PPT or similar, but a sketch can be made during the presentation). In the 5 minutes, details should be presented in as much depth as possible and the content area should be explained as fully as possible (i.e. it is better to narrow down the area and provide more details). Afterwards, further random content from the lecture content will be tested within 25 minutes.  Regards, Philip",
