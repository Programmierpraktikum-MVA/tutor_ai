Just to be 100% sure: I would like to enroll in the 12LP course and also visit the lecture + exam next semester. If I understood correctly, this semester I have to double register; once in the module #40240 (WiSe 24/25) and once in #40253 (SoSe 24). Is this correct?  How are the grades going to be managed at the end if I have a double registration? I would like to habe AWT only once in my master's certificate.  Thank you in advance :)  Ettore Marangon",
