However, in the next weeks I really recommend to joining the following lectures on as all will be also in presence. “Social Network Analytics” (3rd of June) “AI & Machine Learning in Research” (10th of June) “Hierarchical Linear Modelling, Conjoint Analyse, Text Analytcs” (17th of June) “Summary” (24th of June) There is not so much material on this lectures, therefore in order to prepare for the examination joining these four lectures will be of great advantage.
