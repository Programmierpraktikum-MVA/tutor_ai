At the end of the lecture, the arch_1 model and the arch_1_12 model are compared with the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. I remember that the model with a lower AIC or BIC value should be favoured. In this case, the arch_1_12 model has a lower AIC and BIC value, but the professor says that we prefer the arch_1 model. Can someone explain to me how this decision is reached? I would really appreciate an answer. Thank you very much and have a nice rest of the weekend everyone. ",

But isn't it the other way around? Aren't actually the lower AIC values of the AR(5) and 6 to be preferred? In general with so many observations the BIC gives an advantage to simpler models or am I mistaken? Thank you and best regards",

However when looking at the BIC the simpler model has to be preferred. In situations where AIC and BIC do not give an exact decision one usually falls back to the simpler model. I think the professor did not see the negative sign and confused the order as a few slides before the log likelihood was in the negative.   Best Oliver",
