Since we will get the results of these question only after the semester has ended and there is no chance of changing anything for the better for this semester's course, I have created a *very short anonymous voluntary feedback* survey (four questions).  I would be very happy if you could fill it out, so I can get some feeling how you like the course so far and what can be improved.  Kind regards Viktor",

Can the sample solutions of homework be uploaded ?  A. No, but they will be discussed in the exercises and if additional questions arise, you can always email me or come by my office (or exchange ideas with other students).  Q. It is unclear if the extra-exercises are also relevant for the exam.  A. The separation into exercises and extra-exercises is motivated by the following (not exam-related) consideration: the amount of exercises constitutes what you should be able to answer in one week. If you want, you can also do the extra-exercises. The material relevant to the exam consists of the contents of the lecture. The homework exercises are a good way to check if you understood this material well.  Kind regards Viktor",

The exercises are not mandatory and not needed for participating in the exam. However, I recommend you solve them to check your understanding of the lectures contents. I have also added a homework group choice, where you can organize yourselves into homework groups of your choice.  I look forward to seeing you all in the exercise sessions next week! - Viktor",
