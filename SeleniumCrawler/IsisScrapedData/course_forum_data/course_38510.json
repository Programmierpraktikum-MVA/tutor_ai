Just a quick note from me and schedule for tomorrow: We will meet at 12.00 h in front of Quartiersmanagement Rollberg (Falkstr. 25, 12053 Berlin) for the walk. Please note that the address system in the neighbourhood is very confusing. The easiest way to find the Quartiersmanagement is to enter the full name on Google Maps (searching for just the address will lead you to another entrance). The closest U-Bahn station is Boddinstraße (U8). At 13.00 h we will gather at Kiezanker e.V. (Falkstr. 24) for a Q&A with Alex (Quartiersmanagement) and guests from the neighbourhood. You can write down any questions in the Etherpad in advance so we can make sure that they will be addressed tomorrow. See you tomorrow!",
