For the rest, the test is ``closed books'', which means: you cannot have a copy of the slides and of the problems with solutions, you cannot have laptops and other devices connected to the internet, you cannot ask ChatGPT, Wikipedia, and so on .... It is just you, your pen and paper, and your formula sheet to recall things that you may find useful.  Notice that preparing a good formula sheet is a great learning opportunity, since annotating by hand formulas and theorems helps not only remembering but also understanding.   Cheers,   G",
