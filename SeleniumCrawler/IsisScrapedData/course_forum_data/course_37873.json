During the meeting you will get to know the team behind SIERRA, what we're planning for this semester and how to participate. Afterwards we'll give you a tour of our Satellite Ground Station and Mission Control facilities as well as TU Berlins amateur radio station, DK0TU. Including the tours, you should expect the event to take about four hours.  After the kickoff meeting you'll have to write a short letter of motivation. This allows us to arrange sub-teams for specific work packages depending on your knowledge, interests and priorities.  For general questions please wait until the kickoff meeting, as many questions will be answered there. For any special questions feel free to reach out to us via kurs@dk0tu.de. Please also read the information at the top of the ISIS page.  Looking forward to meeting you, Sebastian, Camille, Martin and Timo",
