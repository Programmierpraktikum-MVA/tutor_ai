They are worth 10% of your grade and will be our \"first impression\" of your project before we evaluate the project. They are also your chance to show off to your project to your peers! Unfortunately, we have to cram all presentations into a single lecture, which creates strict time constraints. To alleviate this problem, I kindly ask you to start the lecture five minutes earlier at 14:10 and end it around 15:50 to have 100 minutes for 10 presentations. Submitting slides Each group will have 7 to 9 minutes to present their project: we will strictly cut you off at the 9 minute mark, so practice your presentation! no more than 8 slides of \"content\" are allowed for the presentation (this excludes title slides, references, animations etc.) Only PDFs are allowed, so unfortunately you won't be able to present your project in a Pluto notebook. Please upload the PDF of your presentation slides on ISIS until Monday, July 15th at 12:00 (noon) to give us time to assemble the presentations in one large PDF. Because of this, any late submission will be ignored. Contents Give an overview of your topic Avoid math-heavy explanations Present your package What functionality does it export? What design choices have you made? Demonstrate your code Is your package easy to use and well documented? Discussion & Outlook What problems did you encounter? If you had another 3 months to work on your project, what would you add or change? There will be no time for Q&A. Project upload We've decided to give you a bit more time to polish your projects. The deadline for the upload of the Project Source Code is July 16th at 23:59. Please create a zip archive of your repository and upload it to ISIS. Best regards  Adrian",

This will be a peer review session: Each of you will be randomly paired with a code review partner from a different project. You will have time to look at the state of their repository, try to install (and maybe use?) their package and take a look at their source code. We will give you some guidance on what to look at. You will give online feedback in form of \"issues\" on your partner's repository.  You will then be given some one-on-one time to discuss your findings with your code review partner. Obviously, this requires that your repository is public and not completely empty. But we also don't expect your code to be functional by Tuesday either. We will review each other's work in progress. During all of this, your project supervisors will be available to answer questions on your projects. 2. Please share your repositories In preparation for the code review session, please make your repositories public and share the URL with your supervisor. 3. Updates to the website The JuML website has been updated with a page on writing and hosting documentation. This will be the last update to the site, unless you request some additional information. If you find any errors or typos, you are welcome to fork the course repository and open a PR with fixes. You can also send me an email, but why not become a contributor to the course? :) 4. Feedback Since we are doing the project work for the first time, we welcome your feedback. You can give us anonymous feedback on the JuML course feedback page. Best regards,  Adrian",

Assigning Groups Thanks to your feedback during today's project meeting, I've tried setting up groups that you should self-assign in: https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=1835057 The group names are meaningless and not connected to topics in any way. If you haven't found a group yet, please announce your interests in the Discussion Forum to find like-minded students. 2. Topic Selection After assigning yourself to a group, one representative from your group should rank the available topics: https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/ratingallocate/view.php?id=1834680 I was hoping for this feature to support groups, but it looks like it doesn't. The deadline for both the group assignment and project selection is next Monday, 23:59. 3. Updates to the Website I'm in the process of writing up today's walkthrough on how to set up a Julia project using PkgTemplates.jl. The contents should hopefully be on the JuML website by the end of this week and will get a separate announcement here.  Please let me know if anything is broken and thank you for your understanding if things do not go 100% smoothly–this is my first time organizing project work. Best regards, Adrian",

New project meeting location Since the room for the kick-off meeting was too small, our project meetings will take place in room MA 042 in the maths building. This includes the mandatory project selection meeting next week on May 21st. 2. Project topic proposals Next week, you are going to form groups of four students to work on a project of your choice. While we will give you some options to choose from, your topic ideas are also welcome. You can send me project topic proposals to my email hill@tu-berlin.de until this Friday. Please keep in mind that the project will focus on Julia workflows, such as testing, documentation and CI. So an ideal topic would be something related to Machine Learning that isn't novel research.  Topics that already have a Julia implementation are totally valid, but it would be even better if you suggested a topic that hasn't been implemented yet. Use JuliaHub package search (https://juliahub.com/ui/Home) for this purpose.  Maybe you will end up creating something useful for the wider Julia community? 3. Familiarize yourself with Git It is mandatory that you use Git to version control your project work. If you have don't have any experience with Git, don't be scared–this is a perfect opportunity to learn how to use it. Don't be afraid to try new things, make many mistakes and learn from them. To help out inexperienced people, I will present my workflow of choice at the project selection meeting next week. For this purpose, please install Git on your computer and bring it to the meeting. If you have no experience with Git at all, I suggest you do the following in preparation: Read the \"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\" page on version control Play the video game \"Oh My Git!\", which should work on Linux, macOS and Windows  There is no right or wrong way to use Git. It's a flexible tool that should make your life easier, not harder, so use whatever makes you productive. 4. Set up an account on a code-sharing platform This course has a secret agenda: to turn you into a developer who contributes to the wider Julia ML community. Since the Julia community is mostly organized on GitHub, I encourage you to host your project work on GitHub, which requires the creation of a user account. This has several other advantages: GitHub provides access to remote computers (GitHub Actions) that can be used to run your test suite on each commit. GitHub pages can host your package documentation as a public website.  If you don't want to accept GitHub's terms of service, that is completely understandable and will not affect the grading of your project in any way. In this case, please use TU Berlin's self-hosted GitLab instance at git.tu-berlin.de or another public code-sharing platform of your choice. Whatever you platform you choose, please authenticate yourself by creating and adding SSH keys before next week. This allows you to push commits to these platforms from your command line. If you don't know what this means, guides can be found here: GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh TUB GitLab: https://git.tu-berlin.de/help/user/ssh.html  5. Deadline for the 4th homework Since these points are quite a lot of work for people unfamiliar with Git, I will move the deadline for homework 4 to Thursday, May 23rd. Please prioritize familiarizing yourself with Git until the project meeting. Let me know if you have any questions about any of these points! Best regards, Adrian",
