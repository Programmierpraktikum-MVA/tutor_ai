I found this paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612303000035) that shows the same definition from Wikipedia, I hope this helps.  From my understanding the skewness value should be reflected in your distribution graph, so if it is a positive value, you have a distribution more inclined to the left, if it's negative it should be more inclined to the right and vice versa.",
