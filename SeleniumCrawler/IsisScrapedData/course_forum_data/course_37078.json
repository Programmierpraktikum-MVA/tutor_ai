Therefore, I'm inviting you to our repetition and test preparation session tomorrow. You have the opportunity to ask both Prof. Dr zu Knyphausen-Aufseß and Prof. Dr Pidun your final questions regarding the course content. The session starts tomorrow at 10.15 am using Zoom Link. On ISIS, we additionally prepared an etherpad \"Your questions for the written test\" for you to write down last questions. Please make use of this possibility! Further, the points for your student presentation are now available on MOSES. Please check: Anmeldeübersicht > Details  The published points are your individual points. Since no group has asked for a peer assessment, the individual points correspond to the group results. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow! Best regards, Niko Ippendorf",

However, there were only about 30 students present today (many thanks to them!). Perhaps I need to learn that you are not interested in such practical input and change my teaching program accordingly. I would find that a great pity myself -- I think these inputs are very helpful to really understand and apply the academic material. I don't rule out the possibility that I will ask questions about the content of today's course in the written exam, and I will take the same approach in future courses with practitioners.

I believe that the numbers in the decision tree are mixed because it says that if the incumbent (Player 2) accommodates, the shares are [-1;1] and if the incumbent decides to fight the shares are [2;2]. Isn´t it the other way round, that when the incumbent decides to accomodate, the shares are equal compared to a fight, where both lose but the incumbent slightly less than the entrant? Thanks and regards, Fabian",
