However, there were only about 30 students present today (many thanks to them!). Perhaps I need to learn that you are not interested in such practical input and change my teaching program accordingly. I would find that a great pity myself -- I think these inputs are very helpful to really understand and apply the academic material. I don't rule out the possibility that I will ask questions about the content of today's course in the written exam, and I will take the same approach in future courses with practitioners.

I believe that the numbers in the decision tree are mixed because it says that if the incumbent (Player 2) accommodates, the shares are [-1;1] and if the incumbent decides to fight the shares are [2;2]. Isn¥t it the other way round, that when the incumbent decides to accomodate, the shares are equal compared to a fight, where both lose but the incumbent slightly less than the entrant? Thanks and regards, Fabian",
