However, this won't be me just presenting the solutions. When you wish to talk about one of the exercises (theory or programming) you start with your ideas and approaches. Then I will gladly guide you towards the solutions. The lecture PKC will take place as usual, finishing post-quantum crypto and a general wrap-up. Regards, Henning",

The choice in Isis is open until Monday night the week before the exams (or until all are taken). Reminder: To get an exam, you must both pick a slot in Isis and register in Moses. If your exam is in July or early August, you MUST use the corresponding registration in Moses. For the other slots in late August/September please do the same. They are valid for 3 months.  Unfortunately, in the past, some students were frequently misusing the system for the exams slots, so we had to come up with a few rules. TL;DR be reasonable As we said before, only pick a slot if you can make it at that date and be prepared. If you cancel your slot without valid reason, you will be moved to the \"blacklist\". If you pick 2 slots, we will remove you from both and put you on the \"blacklist\". Being on the blacklist means, you cannot pick a new slots before others had their chance. You will have to live with the leftovers. Regards, Henning",

Additionally, I created a Matrix channel for quick communication about the content, either with me or among yourselves: https://matrix.to/#/#crypto:matrix.tu-berlin.de However, for orga questions without private information please use the forum, to have it documented for everyone. rule of thumb: Matrix: quick question, but forgotten afterwards Forum: stuff that someone might want to look up later Regards, Henning",

The survey should take place from 06/17 - 06/28/2024. The survey period for individual courses can be extended on request. Please forward the link to other people in your group if necessary.  Please pass the link on to the students in the course and give them about 5 - 10 minutes to complete it. You are also welcome to use the QR-code at the end of this email.  Further information on evaluation at Faculty IV and tips for increasing the response rate can be found here.  You will receive the results of the survey after the end of the survey period, so you can still have a feedback meeting within the semester.  If you have any questions, please contact lehrevaluation@eecs.tu-berlin.de.   Many thanks and best regards Teresa Fräßdorf    ",

And yes, protocols are always standardised. Formally, a protocol is a randomised algorithm. And for those, there are two equivalent views f rand ( x ) that internally has nondeterministic/random steps f det ( x , r ) where r is an array of random numbers, but the function itself is now deterministic Hence, it does not matter whether Alice does the computations, or she sends r to Bob and he does the computations. As everything else is deterministic, both will get the same result. And these results are Alice's answers.  Regards, Henning",

If not - s.33 what is the definition of a random tape? I did not find one on wikipedia and other sources are not that helpful either. s. 34 - why does the definition of a one way function hold for arbitrary polynomials? On wikipedia it is only for the one that is an upper bound on the runtim of the PPT algorithm . Also, I know that PPT algorithms have runtime bounded by a polynomial for sufficiently large inputs and their output is probabilistic but how exactly are they probabilistic? Is the chance that its output is false lower than a chosen ? s. 38 what is self-reducibility? Also, are solutions to the posed problems available?",
