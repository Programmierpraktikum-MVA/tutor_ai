Should I call zone 11 a zone group and then only show this zone group for the results?  Or what approach would you chose to focus on zone 11, only, and get the simulations comparable best.

We can look at it the next lecture.  To your other question: Warnings in IDA ICE does not necessarily indicate a problem, it just warns you about a fact. So in this case, those walls are not connected to any zones or exterior environment. This happens either when there is a too big space between zones/between zone and building body, or when you have very small wall portions (this happens usually when the zone is created automatically). Adiabatic refers to that no heat flow happens through that wall. This is usually not a problem, you can run your model just as usual. We can discuss this further next lecture!  Best, Kata",

Afterwards I could run the simulation, but got some weird errors, might just re-do everything from scratch, in order to be able to get a proper simulation.

                                    "Content": "- Whether the building is exposed or sheltered effects the wind pressure coefficients. So you have to go to \"Pressure coefficients\" and choose the profile by clicking on \"Auto fill\". It is indeed a bit hidden.  - HVAC Standard Plant you can find in the \"Palette\" if you open up the \"Side Bar\" on the top of the screen. You have a lot of templates for different Air Handling Units (different controllers, system settings and equipment). In the task we use the \"Standard air handling unit\", but it is also the default one, so you actually don´t have to change anything. - The constant temperature refers to a constant supply air temperature of the ventilation to the zones. This you can define if you open up your \"Air Handling Unit\" and under \"setpoint for supply air temperature\", choose constant and write 16C in the box for \"Constant temp [C]\". - For setting the heat exchanger properties, you also have to open up your Air Handling Unit. The box/object with the \"+\" and \"-\" sign represents the heat exchanger. Open it up and there you can set the \"Effectiveness\" and the \"Heat exchanger operation\" connected to it.  All these settings in the task are by default values in IDA ICE, meaning that you do not have to change anything. We have not dealt with these during the lectures yet, but we wanted you to be aware of its properties for the analysis, as they do effect the results.  I hope I could explain it clearly, let us know if there is anything else!  p.s. the windows are on both floors yes. They should follow when you copy-paste the zones from the first floor to the second. Alternatively, you should also be able to copy-paste them in the 3-D view.",

In today's slides, you'll find details about how the course will be evaluated. 20 % of your grade comes from a portfolio, which includes three different tasks. The first task will be introduced on May 7th, and the deadline to submit is May 20th. I understand you might not be around by then, so we'll try to explain everything clearly in the slides. Since you won't be able to attend the \"Sprechstunde\" dedicated to the task, feel free to ask any questions here on the forum, and we'll try to help you out.  Also, remember to register on the course before May 14th.  Regards, Kata",
