It will be presented by two co-founders of the firm Beyond Urban, ANIRUDH BADARINATH and ANUJA KOTHAWALA.

First, I want to express my concern regarding the absence of many students in the class in previous sessions. Since we only have three more sessions remaining in the semester, I want to see everyone present, especially with two upcoming guest lectures and the final concluding day. The first is tomorrow, and the second is next week. Their busy schedules mean their time is valuable, so let's take advantage of this unique opportunity by attending the entire sessions.  Second, please plan to be present from 10:00 to 13:00 for all the following three sessions (tommorow's session will end soon by 11:00/11:10) . If you have a legitimate reason to leave early, please let me know by email beforehand.  Third, based on the voting results, the final session will be held on Thursday, July 18th, from 10:00 to 13:00 Uhr. We'll be back in the IVP building, room SG04 402 (where we met on June 21st). I am re-sharing the location here again: https://maps.app.goo.gl/unh1zUuxa82Avz4T6.   Fourth, I am sharing the final list of topics and presentation dates for the final semester presentation here.   Fifth, two groups have yet to choose their end-term paper topics. Please finalize your selection as soon as possible. Additionally, for all groups, please share a draft with me for feedback before submitting the final paper on August 30th.  I'll share details about tomorrow's guest lecture in a separate announcement.  Best wishes, Megha Tyagi",

For that I have to change the due date to May 2nd. We'll change that in the kick-off slides.  I'll post a reminder for the registration next week. I'm sorry for causing any confusion.  Also please note that the registration to the course on ISIS ends today. If you want to take this course, please register until 11:59 pm.  Best regards, Carl",
