As previously in the intro-meeting announced, a briefing has been uploaded containing detailed information about the deliverables for this course. Essentially, you are required to maintain a reflective journal that includes all exercises and assignments. This will be a key component of your 6 ECTS coursework and grading. For further details regarding the expected workload and formatting guidelines, please refer to the information available on ISIS. Additionally, I would like to remind you of the upcoming midterm and final meetings - both being online (ZOOM link on ISIS): - Midterm Meeting: June 4th, online from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM - Final Meeting: July 16th, online from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM Please ensure you are actively engaging with the MOOC content by these dates so we can have productive discussions during our meetings. Feel free to use the forum for any questions you have in-between. Best regards, Angela Million",
