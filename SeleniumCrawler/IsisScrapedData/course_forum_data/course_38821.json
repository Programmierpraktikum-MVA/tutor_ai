I was wondering by just implementing the formula: result[u, t, c, z, y, x] = sigma**2 * np.linalg.det(hessian) and changing the sigma from sigma = 1 to e.g. sigma = 35, the change highlights an inverse mask of the tumor.  I thought the tumor should be filled with the SoView2DOverlay module. Regarding the task .pdf it means that in the tumor region the det(hessian) is small -> no intensity peaks. Makes sense, but how to detect desired blobs? Has anybody the same problem? Can somebody give me a hint on that? Or is that the desired outcome? Thank you! Cederic Aßmann",

(This is the module calculating the Hessian. The sigma in the RunPythonScript only scales the result).  2. A blob with an intensity maximum leads to negative eigenvalues => negative determinant. This is why you have a positive determinant at the eyes (dark blob) but a negative determinant at the tumor (light blob). You can try calculating the absolute value of the determinant or by multiplying by -1.  3. As you already see, blob detection is not the best method for tumor segmentation. You will hear about different methods in today's lecture.   For the submission, an implementation of blob detection is fine. You will not need to find the perfect sigma to get the maximum number of points.",

RescaleIntercept/Slope are used to convert the voxel values into a unit. However, a T2-weighted MRI scan is not a quantitative measurement and therefore cannot/does not need to be converted into a unit.  The situation is different for CT scans, for example. CT scans are quantitaive and are mesured in Hounsfield Units.",
