Open the ISIS-course - chapter \"Preparation of the exam (July 08th 2024)\". You have to alternatives. 1) You can watch the screencasts, which are uploaded in the video collection \"Creating a legal assessment of a case\". In sc 1 I read a typical task of the exams in data protection law. In sc 2, 4, ... I read the facts of the case and the questions from original exams that have taken place in the past. In sc 3, 5, ... I explain the solution and the relevant aspects.  Alternatively, you can download the documents (exams), read the facts of the cases and questions on your own, write down your legal opinion and just watch the screencasts in which I explain the solution and the relevant aspects.
