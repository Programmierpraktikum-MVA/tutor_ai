The topic assignment will be done after the initial meeting, within the first week of the teaching period. You will get more details about the assignment process in the initial meeting. We will distribute all relevant information and material via ISIS. Thus, please monitor the announcements as well as the course page. We are looking forward to meet you in person and work on the projects together! Best regards, Julian Heinovski",
