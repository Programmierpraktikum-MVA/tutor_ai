                                    "Content": "Dear colloquium colleagues,  In our session this Wednesday, I would like to discuss with you the visual diary of my ethnographic research with the recent citizen assembly conducted by the parliament, my case study. The idea is to immerse ourselves into the drawings of social interactions and mappings of the spatial arrangements to discuss some particularities when analysing spatial experiences of individuals with plural ethnic and educational backgrounds. I will bring it printed.  An abstract of my research is attached.  Best wishes,  Mariana Morais Researcher at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and PhD candidate at the Technische Universität Berlin   Beyond words to explore participants' experiences in “invited spaces”: Ethnographic research in a German citizens' assembly   The sociology of space recognizes that the interrelationship between subjects and space can reinforce inequalities. However, how intersectional and embodied differences generate plural experiences in participatory spaces is underexplored. Acknowledging multiple social positions is particularly relevant in the context of citizens’ assemblies, which are increasingly selecting individuals by demographic criteria to take part in cycles of intersectoral policy formulation processes, such as national food strategies and mobility plans, under controversial normative premises of representation and inclusivity (see Dean et al., 2022; Dendler, 2021; Faas and Huesmann, 2017). By examining multimodal modes of expression, such as gesture, silence, negotiation, and emotion, we can better understand how socio interactions in assemblies dispersed across time and space define who and how individuals participate (Curato and Doerr, 2022; Bächtiger and Parkinson, 2019). In this research, I explore how participants with plural ethnic origins and educational backgrounds experienced the first citizens' assembly conducted by the German parliament from September 2023 to March 2024 on the topic of food. The research combines sociology of space with an intersectional approach to contribute to the study of participatory democracy. Here, subjective and spatial experiences are seen as intricately linked to bodily inhabitation (Ahmed, 2006).  To explore these nuances, I conduct ethnographic research that combines participant observation, drawings of social interactions, mappings of spatial arrangements, and biographical interviews with eight participants. By combining a visual approach to differences and spatial arrangements with motives and dialogue of personal trajectories, the research unpack how perceptions of similarity, the self-assessment of one's own knowledge and entitlement to participate, are affected, for example, by symbolic and material hierarchies. In this direction, the study explains how participatory invited spaces can reinforce absent presences, silencing, and isolation. Additionally, the biographical approach challenges the accuracy of representation and inclusion, by recognizing particularities in social positions that do not fit easily into fixed categories such as gender or citizenship.
