Please bring all your prototypes from the first tasks to the class, they will set up an exhibition at IfA for the end of the semester. As the milling bit was broken last week and we couldn't get a new one yet we won't be able to mill anything with the robot until the final... Therefore, it is more important for you to work on your designs and structural analysis, and we can go over those on Wednesday. Saki will also show how to create animations of your toolpaths so that you can at least have their simulations in your final presentations. 2) Here is the course evaluation link: https://befragung.tu-berlin.de/evasys/online.php?p=1RHEL Please fill in by July 18.  See you on Wednesday, Stefan+Saki+Pelin",

You need separate trainings for the Holz and Modell workshops, but for the purposes of this class I think either one is fine. You might have seen on the syllabus that next two weeks we have some assignments planned that'd include woodworking, so it'll be important to have at least someone in your team that can use one of the workshops.   So, let me know in this link when you're able to join if you need the training, as soon as possible, preferably by the end of tomorrow May 7. It takes about 3-3.5 hours.  The times are: Friday May 10 12 pm Monday May 13 13:30 Tuesday May 14 10-14 (I'm aware that having the training next week would not give you enough time to do the exercise for next week, in that case we can focus on the design for both assignments and hopefully it will be enough time for you to build the model for both afterwards.)  If you can't do the selected time you'll have to sign up for another training on Isis yourself.   If you also want to get the training for the Holz workshop I believe you can find those on Isis too or contact Mr. Steinwand. But he does not offer trainings in English.  Finally, I was informed that this week is the excursion week for the studios, so if you won't be on class on Wednesday, keep in mind that you will work in 4 groups of 3 for the next 3 weeks. We'll have the sign up on Wednesday.    Congrats and thanks to everyone who read this far.   See those who are in Berlin on Wednesday!",

He can offer another option this Friday at 9 am, can you quickly let me know if you can do this time or not in this form on Isis by the end of today: https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/choice/view.php?id=1832130 If at least half the class can do this date then I will confirm it with him.",
