The survey should take place from 06/17 - 06/28/2024. The survey period for individual courses can be extended on request. Please forward the link to other people in your group if necessary.  Please pass the link on to the students in the course and give them about 5 - 10 minutes to complete it. You are also welcome to use the QR-code at the end of this email.   Further information on evaluation at Faculty IV and tips for increasing the response rate can be found here.  You will receive the results of the survey after the end of the survey period, so you can still have a feedback meeting within the semester.",
