On slide 26 of the lecture on DCDC converter in open loop operation there are two equations I find very confusing and kind of contradicting. In equation 6 the average voltage across the controllable switch is calculated. This equation is clear. But in equation 7 it says that V_DS is equal to V_in which is only the case for the time when the current is zero. Then equation 7 and 8 are plugged into equation 6.  How do we get equation 7? I cant imagine why the average value of V_DS should be V_in, this is only the case during the time of zero current. In my understanding equation 6 and 7 contradict each other.  Could you help me to understand the derivation.  Greeting,  Moritz",
