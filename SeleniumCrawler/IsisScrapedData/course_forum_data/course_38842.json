To this end, we will undertake both theoretical and biographical explorations.  At the centre of our theoretical explorations we will look at approaches by bell hooks, Paul Freire and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in particular. Our own learning biographies will be at the centre of our biographical explorations. This should enable a reflexive approach to our learning experiences and conditions of learning with reference to moments of motivation. In addition, reflecting on these experiences and conditions should sharpen our view of the design of teaching/learning settings.",
