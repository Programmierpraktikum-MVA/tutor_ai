I think we have great projects in the pipeline.  So, the next mandatory step for you is now to fill out the the course entry survey and indicate at which projects you could/want/doesn't want to participate.  You will find the survey here: https://forms.gle/qzpgkkkLscqVVhbx8 Please note: You have to fill out the survey. If you do not participate with the survey, you can't get a seat in AMOS. But please note further. that only because you participate at the survey a seat is not guaranteed.  You will be informed before the first lecture, whether a seat could be offered.  I'll hope to see you in the project. Best regards, Theo Vassiliou  PS: Please appologize if you receive multiple messages. In this case you have reqistered to more than one AMOS module on ISIS for this semester.",
