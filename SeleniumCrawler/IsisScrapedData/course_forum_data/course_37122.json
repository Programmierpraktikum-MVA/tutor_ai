We have important news however: There is a Poster session for all Programmierpraktika the week after your final presentation, where each Praktikum presents the the work done during the semester. We therefore would like to ask you to hand in a poster detailing the work of your project. This poster can be digital, as we will take care of printing them after the presentations are complete. As this is not part of your grade, we will provide a small reward to each group member whose poster gets chosen. One of our groups will be chosen to present their poster there on July 23rd. We will take care of printing it, however your group will need to be present (at least partially) to present your results for roughly two hours.

We will also give some guidance for your internal project organization. Until April 29 (Mon), 23:59h, your team's project manager needs to send us an email containing all members + assigned roles. On May 2 (Thu), your team needs to do a short introduction, so that other groups can get to know you as well (~ 5 min). During your introduction, you should introduce each team member with their role, and explain the tooling you settled on for your project. Until May 5 (Sun), 23:59h, you need to register for the examination on MOSES! We will not have a session on May 9 (Thu), as there is a public holiday. Optional support sessions start the week after, during which you all have a chance to ask us for guidance. On May 12 (Sun), 23:59h, you need to submit your first project diaries.
