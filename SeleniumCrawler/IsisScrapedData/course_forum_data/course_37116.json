I want to send your grades individually, so I can give you individual comments, rather than just a grade. In general, those who have participated in all activities on time until now, have received at least 16% of points. In particular, everyone who attended today's brainstorming session did a great job. Thanks for that.  Also, like last semesters, we would give 5 extra points to the best survey and best presentation. So you would be able to recover points, if needed :)  Best, Arash",

Because those title abstracts are either completely wrong or meaningless, they would not get any grade for this task...  If you are using LLMs, please keep in mind that their errors would be echoed even more in your full version of the paper. Furthermore, I want to point out that the final presentation, which has 50% of the grade, involves extensive Q&A sessions, which would test \"your\" knowledge.  Therefore, I would strongly recommend you to avoid using LLM tools by simply copy pasting their results.  Do not trust LLMs too much: its outcomes are usually worse than what you could have outputted, even with less time. LLM tools, as advanced as they might seem, are prone to hallucination, in such a way that outcome seems reasonable from top, but might have fundamental flaws...  Best, Arash",

Here are some general tips for this task.  Regarding title. 1- The title should be \"correct\" (in terms of claiming what you have, not overclaiming), however, it is okay to not include every property of your system. 2- A correct title can be a bit general, and also \"fun\". For example: \"Where is my Pizza?: Ensuring Validity of off-Chain Transactions\". 3- In general, see the title of your survey as \"advertisement\": it is there to motivate an \"academic\" reader to click on your paper, e.g. when he/she searches it in Google. So keep that in mind, and find a title that would be \"interesting\" to you and your colleague, but still mention some technical properties of the system.  4- Please do not include TUB/INET/BlockNET/... or your names in your title. Assume that you want to send your submission to a real-world conference. Regarding the abstract: There is a quote that says: “I have made this [letter] longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.” So having short but meaningful abstracts is challenging, however, it would show that you spend time on it. Here are a few tips for a good abstract: 1- Please DO NOT copy-paste things from original abstracts. Rather read the original abstracts (and also the paper), put them aside, and try to write understanding in your own words. 2- Then, let yourself, or your colleague, read it critically: does it make sense? Is it \"technically\" sound, and so on? In particular: 3- As I said during the lecture, the abstract can be basically be contents of a good pitch. Hence, comments that I gave you applys here as well: (a) do not overcrowd it with abbreviations and such, (b) it should tell a story (c) it should tell the need for your paper first, then solutions provided, and so on. Regarding easychair (Huiran will give a demo Monday)  0- Try creating account here (as mentioned in the first page of ISIS), instead of easychair.org: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=blocknets24  1- TUB has its own \"spam defense\" system, maybe your registration confrimation email is there! https://www.tu.berlin/en/campusmanagement/it-support/spam-defense-quarantine-management  2- \"nicfd2016@easychair.org\" is not \"easychair\" support email (the tutorial is taken from previous conference, we will update it). The contact form is here, but please send me an email first if you have issue https://easychair.org/utils2/contact  3- PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A PREPRINT. You need to create a paper in blocknets24 conference.",

If you are a M.Sc. Wirtschaftsinformatik student you can take the module as \"wahlpflicht\" (mandatory elective) as part of \"Distributed Systems and Networks\". Additinally you can take any module as \"freie wahl\" (free elective), including the ones you can take as \"wahlpflicht\" so also BlockNet. So you can choose either, and you have to know how you want to structure your studies and how many credits you need in different parts of your study program to make a good decision. When in doubt check your study program regulations (there's a semester table that tells you how many credits you need).  If you are B.Sc. Wirtschaftinformatik you can only take it as \"freie wahl\" (free elective) since the BlockNet module is not used in this study program.  Best, Aleksander",
