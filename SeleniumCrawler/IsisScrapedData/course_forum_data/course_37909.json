The only bummer on the otherwise very successful day (again, great work with the interview!) was the embarrassingly low attendance from people out of this seminar (only 4 [!!] by my count - fortunately, a good number of people from SCIoI and the psychology department appreciated Brian's visit). I'm not sure what the reason for this is (maybe uploading the talks was/is a mistake?), but I really hope that the participation in Katja Liebal's talk next week will be higher again.

However, we felt like there may be some demand for additional feedback & discussion. As mentioned in one of the lectures, we'd happily offer an additional workshop on Tuesday, 04.06.24 - if you want that. We could use that time to discuss the next steps and questions for the outstanding interviews - and maybe yesterday's interview team would care to share their experiences with Sepp Hochreiter with the other groups? So, nobody needs to feel obligated to show up on 04.06., but we'll be around & available for discussions.  Some feedback on whether there is in fact a demand for that would be appreciated ;)  Best, Benny",

After 31.05.2024 (Friday next week), signing in or out of the course won't be possible anymore. We currently have 21 registrations (which is way below the 35 students assigned to a group). Only register for the course if you are assigned to a group! On the other hand, let us know as soon as possible if you are assigned to a group but do not want to register for the course. For a step-by-step guide on how to register, see the previous post. If you are not a TU student you should be able to register as \"Gasthörer*in\". In the past, however, this sometimes did not work, so it might be easier to send an email to camilla.groiss@tu-berlin.de with your name, university, and matriculation number. As discussed before, we can only reward you with 3 ECTS for completing this course (including HU / M&B students). If there is a person in your group you have not yet heard from / does not seem to be interested in contributing to the group work, please let us know now. I know this is an awkward situation, but informing us before the registration deadline will save everyone involved a lot of emails and nerves later on. If you have questions, please use the reply function here since it might be relevant to more people. (If you have a private question, you can still ask me via mail.) Best, Nico",

As discussed, you can ask them similar questions you would also like to ask the external expert, but make sure to also familiarize yourself with the work of the SCIoI PIs. A few thoughts: Alex Kacelnik will most likely not be in Berlin, but I hope he will be available via Zoom. Martin Rolfs will probably be available in person on May 30th. If Jens Krause does not have time, we can ask Pawel Romanczuk (https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/pawel-romanczuk/) The groups of Asifa Majid (Rasha Abdel Rahman) and Sepp Hochreiter (Alan Akbik) are also welcome to contact the SCIoI PIs, but it might make sense to focus on interviewing the external experts first Alan Akbik will give a talk on the work in his group / at SCIoI (https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/event/pi-lecture-with-alan-akbik-2/). I won't be able to join, but it might be a good chance to talk to him / get to know his work. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions about these interviews; just post them here (or send them to roth@tu-berlin.de).",

If you feel like you have been assigned to the wrong group or you are in no group but want to join the course, let me know as soon as possible, latest by the end of this week. You should see your group affiliation within ISIS, below there is the updated table.

I cannot verify the process myself (as I'm not in the system as a student), but Camilla provided a (German) instruction on how to do it. Please find the DeepL translated version below. (As a short update for all M&B / HU students: You will definitely be able to attend the course for 3 ECTS as described in the TU Modulbeschreibung [as \"Nebenhörer*in\"]. It is still being debated if we can also offer the course as 5 ECTS, sorry for that.) Anleitung zur Prüfungs-Anmeldung über MOSES Melden Sie sich auf MOSES mit Ihren TU-Zugangsdaten an. Klicken Sie oben auf \"MTS,\" dann links im Menü auf \"Modulprüfungen\" und dort auf \"An-/Abmelden.\" Klicken Sie auf \"Neue Prüfungsanmeldung erstellen\" und wählen Sie das aktuelle Semester, Sommersemester 2024, aus. Geben Sie den Modultitel \"Communicating Hot Topics in Intelligent Research\" ein und wählen Sie das Modul mit der Nummer 41185 aus. Wählen Sie die Prüfung aus, zu der Sie sich anmelden wollen. Gehen Sie dann sorgfältig alle Schritte durch den Wizard durch und bestätigen Sie die Übersicht auf der letzen Seite. Erst nachdem Sie den Wizard komplett durchlaufen haben und am Ende nochmal auf Speichern geklickt haben, wird Ihr Antrag gespeichert. Überprüfen Sie umgehend, ob Sie den Prozess erfolgreich durchlaufen haben, indem Sie überprüfen, ob die Anmeldung in Ihrem Profil oder in der Anmeldeübersicht angezeigt wird. Sollte Ihre Anmeldung dort nicht zu finden sein, müssen Sie den Wizard erneut durchlaufen. Achten Sie dabei darauf, diesen unbedingt komplett (entsprechend unserer Beschreibung) durchzuklicken.  Sollte es weiterhin zu Problemen kommen, wenden Sie sich bitte umgehend an das Sekretariat des Fachgebietes (sekr@ni.tu-berlin.de), um Unterstützung zu erhalten. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie nach erfolgreicher Anmeldung noch nicht zur Prüfung zugelassen sind. Nachdem der Anmeldezeitraum geendet hat, wird von uns geprüft, ob Sie ordnungsgemäss angemeldet sind und Ihr Status auf \"Zugelassen\" geändert. Nur dann können Sie an der Prüfung teilnehmen. Studierende anderer Universitäten können sich NICHT auf MOSES anmelden und schicken daher eine e-mail an die o.g. Sekretariatsadresse unter Angabe Ihres Namens, Ihrer Matrikelnummer und der Heimatuniversität. Die Anmeldefrist endet für ALLE Teilnehmenden am 31.05. um 23:59:59 Uhr. Bitte beachten Sie, dass danach systembedingt weder An- noch Abmeldungen möglich sind. ______________________ English translation: Instructions for exam registration via MOSES Log in to MOSES with your TU access data. Click on \"MTS\" at the top, then on \"Module examinations\" in the menu on the left and then on \"Register/deregister.\" Click on \"Create new exam registration\" and select the current semester, summer semester 2024. Enter the module title \"Communicating Hot Topics in Intelligent Research\" and select the module with the number 41185. Select the exam you want to register for. Then carefully go through all the steps in the wizard and confirm the overview on the last page. Your application will only be saved once you have completed the wizard and clicked Save again at the end. Check immediately whether you have successfully completed the process by checking whether the application is displayed in your profile or in the application overview. If you cannot find your application there, you will need to go through the wizard again. Make sure you click through it completely (according to our description). If you continue to have problems, please contact the departmental office (sekr@ni.tu-berlin.de) for support. Please note that you are not yet admitted to the exam once you have successfully registered. After the registration period has ended, we will check whether you have registered correctly and change your status to \"Admitted\". Only then can you take the exam. Students from other universities CANNOT register on MOSES and therefore send an e-mail to the above-mentioned secretariat address, stating your name, matriculation number and home university. The registration deadline for ALL participants is May 31 at 11:59:59 pm. Please note that, due to the system, neither registrations nor deregistrations are possible after this time.

He wrote us again now that - despite the circumstances - he is planning to come and he sent us the updated details for his talk.  Title: Collective intelligence in animals and robots  Abstract In 1905 the biologist Edmund Selous wrote of his wonderment when observing a flock of starlings flying overhead they circle; now dense like a polished roof, now disseminated like the meshes of some vast all-heaven-sweeping net...wheeling, rending, darting...a madness in the sky. He went on to speculate They must think collectively, all at the same time, or at least in streaks or patches  a square yard or so of an idea, a flash out of so many brains. Today, we still know relatively little about how social interactions connect brains togetherand thus how sensing and information processing arises in such organismal collectives. Employing automated tracking, computational reconstruction of sensory information, biomimetic robotics, and immersive holographic virtual reality (VR) experiments, I will explore geometric principles of collective decision-making that occur across scales of biological organization, from neural dynamics to animal collectives. In doing so I will explain why classical models from non-linear statistical physics fail to account for collective animal behavior. I will will present several new theoretical frameworks, including active inference and neural ring attractor networks, that do account for key experimental findings and challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder within animal collectives.",
