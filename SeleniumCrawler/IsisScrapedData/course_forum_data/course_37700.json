Don't forget that today Yan and Ali will be in class to help anyone with the correct installation of software needed for the assignments and project: Python, Anaconda, and Juypter Notebook. It's not mandatory, but if you choose to opt out: Then any future issues are on you to debug. If you do go, please try to be on time.
