Group A starts at 8 am; Group B starts at 9 am. Group A - you are in Group A, if your last name starts with A to L Group A starts with the written test at 8:00 am (s.t.). Please be at the entrance of the room 5 to 10 minutes before 8 am. All participants must stay in the room until the test ends at about 8:45 am. Afterward, Group A leaves the room through the dedicated exit. Group B - you are in Group B, if your last name starts with M to Z or any other character Group B starts with the written test at 9:00 am (s.t.). Please be at the entrance of the room 5 to 10 minutes before 9 am and wait until we open the door to not disturb Group A. After the test, Group B leaves the room through the dedicated exit.  You find the entrance to the Unix Pool by following the signs from the MA building’s main entrance on. Best regards,  Tanja ",

Also, you can expect different questions, from multiple-choice and drag-and-drop to short open-ended questions. Results from previous years with such types of tests have shown that the material provided in the online lectures, together with the homework and additional material, is enough to receive good points and have a good grade in this course. Also, a short Mock-up Test will be available for you from next Monday, so that you can see what type of questions there could be, but will not simulate full length of the test. I hope this helps.",

However, when we say a system is \"multimodal,\" it means it uses more than just one type of input (for all of the above it is touch). A multimodal system can understand input from voice commands, hand gestures, or even where you're looking. This makes it easier and more natural for people to interact with machines. So, while a normal computer with a keyboard, mouse, and screen does use different ways to interact (like typing and clicking), a truly multimodal system is one that uses more than two different types of inputs to work better.

                                    "Content": "Hello, we have a question about the second part of the third task - handling modality fission.  Background information: Our game implements clicking/hovering with the mouse on moving objects (first modality) and speech recognition to slow down the speed of the moving objects (second modality). When we click on the moving object, it vanishes and we get 1 point. We handled modality fusion the way that we click on the moving object while at the same time saying the colour that object has and the action this triggers is that the object vanishes and we get a higher amount of points.  Actual question: We handled modality fission in the way that once we click on a moving object, while saying the WRONG colour, we lose points. Now we are unsure, if this design actually meets the criteria of \"modality fission\". Our thoughts: In our current design the system deals with a  scenario in which there is no possible fusion of the input coming from the two different modalities, since the two inputs DON'T MATCH. However, this design does not actually put the system in the difficult position of having to deal with two CONFLICTING messages, since using only the second modality and saying a colour while not clicking on a matching object does not trigger ANY action on its own.  Please let us know soon if our current implementation fullfills the task, or if this is not actually something you would let pass as \"fission solution\" and we really need to go for a scenario where two CONTRADICTORY actions are triggered at the same time via the two different modalities.

However, to fully meet the criteria for modality fission, your system should handle independently triggered and potentially conflicting actions from both modalities, requiring the system to resolve these conflicts.  A stronger implementation of modality fission would involve both modalities being capable of independent actions, with the system resolving conflicts when both actions occur simultaneously but contradict each other. I would in your position rething what could you add on top to be able to fully showcase scenario for fission.  Hope this helps. Tanja",

The purpose is not to create 15-minute gameplay but to create your own game so that you can explain the storyline of it, explain what two modalities you use for what in your game, and how those two modalities work together. If you go task by task and answer it in your presentation (in 3 or 15 minutes), you will be successful with this project. There is no hard limit on timing for gameplay or presentation. It is necessary that you understand tasks, explain them, show implementation, and record your presentation. Hope this helps.",

We have discussed the modalities we want to implement but we are now a bit conflicted.  We first thought of using the keyboard for the haptic modality (allowing the player to move up and down) and voice commands for the auditory modality (e.g., \"move up,\" \"move down,\" \"shoot\"). However, we are uncertain if this is the right way to implement the modalities.  Another possibility we considered is having the auditory modality involve sound feedback when the player shoots and the visual modality represented by visual effects, such as a ball shooting at opponents.  Could you please clarify which approach we should take?  Best regards, Enea",

I'm Leo (29 yo; with a little daughter; working as an engineering lead for NXP besides studying) & I'm looking for a group :) I study Master Computer Science and am near the end (4th Semester). I do know lot's of different programming languages (C/C++,Rust,Python,Lisp,Ruby,Idris,Haskell,...) but for the purposes of the course project I'd want to use C# (which I've never used before; is not a deal breaker though!). Generally, I guess I'm pretty experienced with programming, but have never worked with Unity before. Additionally, I'm very good with git & gitlab/github and have a fair amount of experience with regards to working in software in teams.  With regards to the project's scope, I'm looking for something not complex with the vanilla keyboard + speech modalities. I wouldn't want to join a group with larger ambitions, since I need to juggle my family & my work besides university.  I prefer to meet digitally or on fridays at the campus. Besides English, I also speak German (nativ).  Currently, I'm all alone and am looking to form a group or join an existing one. If anyone is interested, PM me on ISIS!  Best, Leo",

We, an international team of researchers, would like to know your attitudes towards integrating GenKI tools and applications into your academic learning. GenKI applications enable natural conversations between humans and machines and offer intelligent features such as question answering, text critique, reasoning and programme planning. Their ease of use offers multiple learning opportunities with great pedagogical potential. We would be delighted if you could take a few minutes (about 10 minutes) to participate in our survey. Your opinion is important and will help us to better understand GenKI's contribution to academic learning. The survey is anonymous and your data will be treated confidentially. The information collected will be stored in anonymised form on a password-protected computer and will only be used for research purposes. Here is the link to the survey: https://befragungen.ovgu.de/GenAI/",
