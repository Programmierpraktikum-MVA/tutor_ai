The locomotive broke down, and instead of waking up shortly before Berlin, I woke up in the train station of a tiny Czech village, where we had to wait (without electricity and internet) until another locomotive came and we could continue our journey... Traveling is always some kind of adventure, I guess. I have adjusted our schedule. You will find it attached here, and you can also find it again on ISIS. See you again next week!
