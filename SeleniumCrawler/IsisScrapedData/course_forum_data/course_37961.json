So we had to got on the hunt for lecture halls ourselves and fortunately were successful, albeit with the necessity to accept a new time slot on Tuesday. So, our current lecture times are Mondays, 10:15-10:45 Tuesdays, 16:15-18:45 and the lecture hall is in BH-N 243. This is the \"Bergbau und Hüttenwesen\"-building right new to the U-Bahn exit Ernst-Reuter-Platz; see https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/uni-leben/campusplan . Looking forward to seeing you there next week, Peter Bank PS Contrary to what the red marker may suggest, the entrance to the building is actually in the lower right (aka South East) corner of the attached map.",
