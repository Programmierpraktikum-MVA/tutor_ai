To remind you, you have a limit of 15 minutes to present, followed by a 5-minute discussion. Please remember that content beats the time limit – you can keep the presentation shorter than 15 minutes if you cover all the relevant details. We have 9 presentations in total and will use both the lecture and seminar slots. To ensure everything runs smoothly, please upload your slides on ISIS (“slides submission”) or send them to me via email (blizniukova@tu-berlin.de). Here is the current time plan: Slot 1: 12:15 - 13:40 12:15 - 12:20: Introduction and setup 12:20 - 12:40: Topic 1: Dynamic LCA 12:40 - 13:00: Topic 2: Life-LCA 13:00 - 13:20: Topic 3: Nutritional LCA 13:20 - 13:40: Topic 4: Inventory data for chemicals Break: 13:40 – 14:00 (20 minutes) Slot 2: 14:00 – 15:45 14:00 - 14:20: Topic 5: Pharmaceuticals in LCA 14:20 - 14:40: Topic 6: City OLCA 14:40 - 15:00: Topic 7: Distance-to-Target 15:00 - 15:20: Topic 8: Consequential LCA (Building sector) 15:20 - 15:40: Topic 9: Circularity in LCA 15:40 – 15:45: Wrap-up Looking forward to your presentations!

During the seminar, two questions regarding the IO tables were raised: 1)      Meaning behind the total intensity F and its connection to the Leontief inverse: This parameter functions as a characterization factor and includes both direct emission intensity (of the sector itself) and indirect (upstream) intensity associated with all flows consumed by a sector from other sectors. In the seminar solution spreadsheet, I included a detailed visualization of how this term is calculated. While the Leontief inverse aggregates all flows going into a sector from upstream processes (like a tree, see the visualization), the F factor combines the emissions intensity with all these flows. I will go into this in detail during the summary lecture.  2)      Why is the total output equal to the total input: The IO table represents the entire economy. This means that its output cannot be larger that what has been “invested”: resources/services, but also value added (e.g., taxes, labour). Thus, total input represents the cost of production, while total output reflects the final value of produced goods and services. These two values should be equal due to the principle of economic equilibrium. These questions, like the seminar content, will not be part of the exam, but thank you for raising such interesting points! Best regards, Daria  ",
