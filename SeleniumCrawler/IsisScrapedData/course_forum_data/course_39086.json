I'm opening this post because the tasks to do are unclear to me, except for the second one \"submitting a brief answer to standard questions about each paper ahead of the class\".  Could you please elaborate on what we have to do precisely regarding the first and last task ? What could be an example or the methodology to build a research proposal ? I understood that the paper assignment that we just received concerned the final presentation of 8 minutes.  But what about the presentation that we have to do in groups of two ? When will that be decided ? I would like to balance the workload of my semester and work on this seminar early.  Have a nice day, LÈo Paoletti.",

Here is a short summary of what I would suggest based on Iyad Rahwan's remarks in the first lecture. We might come up with something more formal next week.  The objective of the presentation is to spark a discussion in the group. We also would like you to prepare to facilitate the discussion. To do so, you probably want first to present a summary of the paper.  The papers are different, but in general I would suggest structuring the summary along the basic structure of: * Motivation / Research questionsóWhat motivated the research? Which particular gap in the literature did this paper intend to close? Is there one central other work this paper references? If yes, also provide a short summary of that work. * MethodsóWhich methods were used? Prepare a short explanation of this work's most central methods. To do so, you might look into related literature, but I would avoid long excursions. If the paper has supplementary material, I highly recommend skimming these as well. Many times, these help to properly understand what has been done. I suggest focusing on what has been done and not how the authors tell the story of what has been done. * ResultsóWhat are the main results? The key here is to discuss the paper's figures.  It might then be advisable to prepare open questions that could spark a discussion. The questions can be related to the questions that all of you have to answer. However, there can also be other questions that you perceived as relevant during the preparation.  No slides are generally required, but I would advise you to prepare some, as this generally helps to structure the presentation and makes it easier for everyone to follow.  Best, Levin",
