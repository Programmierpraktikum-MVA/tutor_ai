These two forms of the Navier-Stokes equation can be converted into each other using the product rule. The form of the equations is important for different numerical schemes. The conservative form can be solved by FDM, FEM and FVM. However, the non-conservative form is only applicable to FDM and FEM schemes. For the FVM only conservative form is possible. The non-conservative form scheme FEM is globally conservative but locally not conservative. The FDM is not necessarily conservative. The FVM, on the other hand, is globally and locally conservative. This has an impact on the accuracy of the approximation of steep gradients such as the dam break.  Best regards, Can",
