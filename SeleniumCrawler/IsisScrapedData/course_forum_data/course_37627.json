I think we have great projects in the pipeline.  So, the next mandatory step for you is now to fill out the the course entry survey and indicate at which projects you could/want/doesn't want to participate.  You will find the survey here: https://forms.gle/qzpgkkkLscqVVhbx8 Please note: You have to fill out the survey. If you do not participate with the survey, you can't get a seat in AMOS. But please note further. that only because you participate at the survey a seat is not guaranteed.  You will be informed before the first lecture, whether a seat could be offered.  I'll hope to see you in the project. Best regards, Theo Vassiliou  PS: Please appologize if you receive multiple messages. In this case you have reqistered to more than one AMOS module on ISIS for this semester.",

In your first ISIS announcement you mentioned about a course entry survey and that it can be found in the project organisation document.  Does this mean that: - there will be a new tab added to the google sheet ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1103O1WLW8HLqIrjXs-KdT1fYf0e-IdrHH1hk2uRjTCA/edit#gid=6_ ) - or a link added at the index tab of that sheet - or will be a survey added at the UNI1 moodle instance [ https://myc.uni1.de ] - or maybe something else?  Is there any \"early-bird\" advantage when it comes to our acceptance in the course if we fill the survey before the partner presentations on April 10th or the time rank of students filling the form plays no role in the selection?  I suppose the details are about to be explained further on April 10th, I just want to make sure I do not miss some step before that date.  Thank you in advance for your answers.  Best George",
