The learning content is available via-self access here on ISIS Please excuse the duplication of content on ISIS - the site is very messy at the moment with each piece of content being repeated numerous times. I am slowly trying to tidy this up. Please make sure you have filled out your information in the survey titled \"SoSe 2024 Bitte Sofort Nach Eintragen in den Kurs Ausfullen\" I look forward to welcoming you all to the course. Please contact me with any question you might have Best regards Dorian Hanaor",
