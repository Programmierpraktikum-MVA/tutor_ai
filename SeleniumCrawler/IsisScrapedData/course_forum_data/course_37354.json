Sentinel 2 data does not have ultraviolet bands (10–400 nm). Therefore, we have updated the exercise text in task 1 (2 words) to reflect the colours wanted. You can find the updated version on [2]. The plot in the task description did not change because it used the infrared band.  You can go to the discussion forum on link [1] for further clarification. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Therefore, OSM data only for Berlin should contain almost all the buildings. 2. Yes, that sounds fine, and no, you do not need to implement a function that takes coordinates as input unless you want to. But, since the evaluation should only contain buildings inside the specified range. Unless you have some excellent reasons not to follow the description of the task, it is most likely beneficial for you to implement such a function.

I will try to explain my problem clearly below.  According to documentation, pixel values for RGB bands must be included in [0-10,000], which is what I obtain when I'm not trying to remove clouds from the image. I've tried two different implementations for cloud removal, and they both display the same problem. For temporal dimension reduction, I use the 'median' reducer, but the problem also happens when using 'mean' or 'first' reducers.  - My first implementation is to use the max_cloud_cover argument of connection.load_collection. Using the value 1% (because 0% doesn't seem to work), I notice that the pixel values I obtain are included in [-32768, 17432] in int16 or [1, 65531] in uint16. This behaviour is weird. - My second implementation consist of using the SCL band to mask pixels with clouds. The dimension reducer should then only use pixels without clouds and return a clear image. But I obtain the exact same problem as the first implementation, as my pixel values are outside of [0-10,000].  Again, when ignoring cloud masking, the pixel values are spread correctly.  I really don't understand where my mistake is. Do you have any insight about this specific issue?  Thank you, Elias",

The interesting thing is when you download an image with clouds the values are consistently high on all bands. Therefore a 'simple' cloud cover removal would be to filter out sliced blocks that have 'high' pixel values. I am unaware of what the issue is as well, but I worked around this limitation because it is how the source data is.  To make it concrete I used two different cloud removal strategies (both very primitive). 1. Use the max_cloud_cover argument when interacting with openeo or any other image provider. 2. Filter sliced blocks from the training data that contain 'too many' high-valued pixels indicating that it contains clouds.  Is it the best solution? I do not think so, but it is sufficient for solving the task.  Best regards Sebastian",

It seems like it rounds to the nearest larger block, based on my experience.  The most elegant solution I found (there are probably better ones) is to project the OSM data onto the projection of the satellite images, not the other direction. One argument for this solution is that the lowest resolution data is the satellite images, while the OSM building data is at a much finer granularity.

Therefore, for the test image, it should be possible to predict the entirety of the Berlin image by the coordinates provided without having to construct sub-image patches. The only reason I can see for predicting patches is to reduce memory requirements.  > So does it mean that we should also create a coordinate mapper to produce the sub-image patch from the larger image?  What do you mean in this question? If I understand it correctly, then yes. Your task one pipeline should be able to create (almost) any size image, and the prediction pipeline should be able to segment those images. When you train the model you can choose a consistent size of patches to make the training efficient.  > Also another one about 1x1 output convolution : \"The single value should indicate if the pixel contains a building.\" > Does it mean the complete image hence the pixels there right? It confused me a little there too.  The 1x1 output convolution is a single value per pixel, but it translates to many in a picture. I think you have thought of it as a fully connected layer. In the fully connected case, it would be a single classification of the entire input rather than one per pixel.   Hope this helps, otherwise just ask again.  Best regards Sebastian",

The task is flexible for you to construct any pipeline that downloads and processes the images to the specified bands.  I downloaded the images from the suggested provider in the task description worked out fine for me. The difficulty is that the images are not in the standard format that you would expect. Therefore, to make sense of the downloaded data you have to analyze the values and look at the documentation to make it work.  One benefit of the suggested provider is that you can specify cloud coverage and time range. Another is that you can push certain preprocessing operators to the cloud before you get the result downloaded to reduce the amount of data received.  If you have issues with it you can always join the office hours.  Best regards Sebastian",

We have downloaded the OSM data for a city, extracted the boundaries and buildings, and, using the boundaries, downloaded the Sentinel2 data for that area.  However, we can't find a good way for aligning the buildings with the satellite images.  We tried going over each pixel and checking if the position in that pixel is within any of the building polygons, but that would take multiple days for even just a single city.  We also tried exporting the buildings as as png image and overlaying it over the satellite image, but didn't find a way to scale them correctly so that they align.
