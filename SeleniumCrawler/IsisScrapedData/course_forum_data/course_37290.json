It was a little chaotic as I did not enable group submission for the project here on ISIS. So I hope I got it all right in terms of providing feedback and entering all  the grades. If not let me know.  The grades might seem on the low side, but are not considering that the project needs to be seen in the context of the reading as well. So projects are evaluated much stricter so as to balance the relatively easy reading part of the module. But maybe you can also consider this as motivation - in particular with respect to thinking and relating concepts towards the lectures and readings some more!",

Please get together in your group asap and set up a first meeting of 1.5 hours for next week. You can use the CSE ICE room for the meetings if you want to. Please let me know when you will meet next week. As mentioned we might join the group work as well. Also use this first session to set up your regular weekly work time (1.5 hours per week) - also inform us when you will meet every week! I am really looking forward to the course this year!
