Still, I'm kinda curious about the reasons. Of course, I want to offer interesting projects to the students in the future so I would like to know: what was the problem with this project? what made you quit? You would help me if you gave me some honest feedback that I can try to work on for the next time. Well, and regarding the students who didn't write me to inform me about them leaving the project - are you still with me? I'd love to continue the project, even with a small group. Let me know what you think. Best regards, CLemens",

Thus, I am now quite busy with more credits and I won’t be able to cope. The project continue to be very interesting, with a very hands on application and project development experience. From my side, there was/is nothing “wrong”, but as mentioned, the workload would sufocante the other classes.  Regards Renato",
