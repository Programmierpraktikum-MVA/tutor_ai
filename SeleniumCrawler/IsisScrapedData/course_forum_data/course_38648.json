The first exercise is mostly organizational and provides a voluntary homework. I recommend solving the first homework, so you can setup your python environment and get a minimal OpenCV application running. Next week I will go over the organizational stuff and continue regularly.  See you next week!  Best Simon",

General CV - objection detection, classification - understanding concept of feature engineering and feature extraction - introduction slides - correspond to 6. Various  2. Hough / General Hough Transform / R-Tables - binary image - gradient information - tempalte - voting space    - difference between working with binary image and gradient information    - votings are different!    - gradient information returns one specific line and not various possibilities - how it works for line detection - improved versions of R-Tables    - correlations    - gradients and complex nubmbers - see homework - e.g. how could hough transform looks like for a circle - understand how to create an algorithmen   3. Baysian Methods - MLE/MAP/Bayes Estimation    - definitely one task where to estimate some parameter of some probability distribution (MLE ?)    - see homework - Discriminators / Classifiers    - giving a classifier: what is the error ?   4. Machine Learning in General - Bias-Variance Decomposition    - compute bias (or both) for certain estimator - Generalization (Train-Test Split / K-Fold)    - implification of bias and variance    - why use k-fold cross validation ?    - why dont we use the training data to evaluate the perfomance - underfitting and overfitting   5. Deep Learning (more signification Topic! 30-40%) - Architectures    - MLP: Parameters like depth, width (number of neurons)    - CNN: stride, kernel size, dilation, padding (signification part!)    - Transformers: Attention Methods, how do they work mathematically, why do we use the models - Optimization: SGD, Mpmemtum, Adam    - dont fully need to understand Adam    - typical question:       - graph (level set, function) given       - some kind of optimization goes through       - what is the most likely optimization function used here ?       - is there a small or large learning rate ? - Regularization: Batch-Normalization, Dropout, Residuals, Skip    - why we use them ? - Various Models (how we train the models)    - Autoencoder       - concept of embeddings (project data into much smaller space), trained feature space    - VAE    - GAN    - self supervised training (not too much into depth)    - supervised training (not too much into depth)   6.

To clarify if I am understood correctly the notation from Slide 12 of Exercise 3: O(x,y) is the Object, I(x,y) is the original image and O^I is the objects gradient and I^I the images gradient. The function header calcBinaryMask declare the input as an image and should calculate the gradient it self. BUT step 2) of the slide 46 and the TODO in the correlation function needs compute the templates gradients and normalize it AFTER copying and circular shifting the templates gradient into a larger frame. Now my question: Should calcBinaryMaskimg normalize the templates gradient too ? Should the larger frame with the normalize and masked template gradient again be normalized ? Otherwise when calculation T = O^B * O^I I have a mismatch of size because O^B is large as the original template and O^I is in the larger frame in size of the original image I would be happy if someone can help me def calcBinaryMaskimg(img, thresh = 0.3):     \"\"\"     Compute the gradient of an image and compute a binary mask     based on the threshold. Corresponds to O^B in the slides.     Parameters     ----------     img : ndarray         an image     thresh : float         A threshold value. The default is 0.3.     Returns     -------     binary : ndarray         A binary image.     \"\"\"  ",

I think It doesn't matter, since the output is Binary, initially normalized or not the result is the same  2. Should the larger frame with the normalize and masked template gradient again be normalized ? I am not sure If I understand properly, but yeah the template you use for the correlation should be normalized. following the order of the tasks in the exercise, you should first have it in a larger frame ->apply circular shift -> normalize  3. for the mismatch T = O^B * O^I I think you tried to apply the mask to the \"template gradient in large frame\", I suggest you to first apply the mask to the original-frame template gradient then do the rest.  I hope this could help you Regards",

The description for the function binarizeImage states:     Given a coloured image and a threshold binarizes the image.     Values below thresh are set to 0. All other values are set to 255 The information for one pixel contains of three values (BGR). When I apply the threshold to each color value of each pixel, the image is of course not black and white, but with pixel which only 0 or 255 for each BGR values. Is this the supposed way or should  we set all BGR of one pixel to 0 / 255 according to the threshold ? If yes how to check for \"Values\" ?      B < tresh (AND, OR, XOR, ..) G < tresh (AND, OR, XOR, ..) R < tresh  Thanks!",
