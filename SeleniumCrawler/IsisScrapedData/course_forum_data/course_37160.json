To that end, the first page of the pdf also includes a list of resources to find more articles on our topic. Once you've decided upon an article for your presentation, please register your presentation in this registration sheet. When you register your slot, please do not forget to remove the article of your choice from the list of articles to choose from on the second tab, so we don't hear about the same article twice.
