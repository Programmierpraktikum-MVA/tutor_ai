I’m very excited to see this project come together and I look forward to seeing how this data ends up looking. I’ve created a data repository in ISIS for all students to upload their data. It is located at the start of the course page under the “Project Description” header, below the “Announcements” section. Please label your files and photos clearly. Please upload your data to the correct section. You can then export the portions of the data that you are interested in. I’ve created a very important to-do list below. All students must review these tasks and make sure they complete their portions of the necessary work. Please reach out if you have any questions. Sincerely, Christopher  To Do List for Next Week Sampling location tasks: -ASAP = Generate the random sampling locations for Adlershof so that they can be confirmed for our visit -Re-generate the Grünau points so that they are in the appropriate non-conservation locations for soil sampling purporses as requested -Please submit polygons used & generated sampling locations Excursion week tasks: -Confirm dates and location of out-of-city trip                   (From the poll in WhatsApp, it looks like Warsaw from Tuesday to Friday) -Three documents need to be completed and are located on ISIS:                   -Studienfahrt Antrag mit Zuschoss                   -Liste der teilnehmende Studierende                   -Outline of activities that we will be doing during the excursion week                   (this can be made in a Word document, I don’t have a template for this). -Return these three requested documents to me by e-mail -Figure out date(s) and details for in-city excursion, as well. I suspect we need these three forms for the in-city activities, too. Soils/Surface Temperature group: -Digitize data and notes & upload photos -Include GPS location data & accuracy for sampling locations if possible -Someone comes to lab to transcribe the text from the bags into an Excel file Social science group: -Digitize data and notes & upload photos -Include GPS location data & accuracy for sampling locations if possible Tree group: -Digitize data and notes & upload photos -Include GPS location data & accuracy for sampling locations if possible -Someone needs to download the LAI data from the device (if you have not already). Upload this data, as well. -Work with LAI data and/or contact the appropriate people to get guidance on how to work with this data. Make sure the data looks meaningful prior to collecting more data in Adlershof Biodiversity group: -Digitize data and notes & upload photos -Include GPS location data & accuracy for sampling locations if possible  ",

If you are interested in coming, please let me know beforehand, but otherwise let's plan to meet at this described location.  Sincerely, Christopher",

                                    "Content": "Hello all, I hope you all had a nice holiday yesterday and enjoyed your break from classes and possibly work. Some quick announcements regarding the course: 1)        Please make sure to do your literature review for the week. I think it would make sense for all students to read a second article. You can use the Etherpad from Week 3 to keep track. We need to identify *specific* methodological approaches that we can mimic for our field work. That is the goal of our literature review currently. 2)        I saw the WhatsApp comment regarding funding for Excursion Week, and I’m sorry to hear we’ve missed a deadline. This is entirely out of my control, considering I was not hired for this position until February of this year, already after this January deadline. For the students who agreed to organize Excursion Week activities, please continue to make progress on this work, and you can use the WhatsApp chat to keep in discussion with the class. 3)        Regarding the final paper – I expect the final paper will be broken into sub-sections (perhaps by biodiversity, soil/water, trees/canopy, and social dynamics). Every student will be responsible for specific portions and will be assessed based on their contributions. I expect we will start delegating out individual responsibilities for the paper once we finish our field work and have some data to work with. 4)        Please use the Etherpad to update about potential locations we can sample. We will need to decide on locations next class and then immediately coordinate visits. 5)        Lastly, I want to remind everyone that an invitation was extended to students from our course to go to the TU campus building in Steglitz next Tuesday from 1 PM to 3 PM to meet with another project course who is developing a low-cost passive air/soil monitoring station prototype. So far, I’ve only had one student express interest. I think it would be nice for at least a few students to attend. Please let me know if you have interest. This would be a good opportunity particularly for the sub-group focused on soil/water dynamics. Thanks everyone! Please reach out if you have questions or concerns, and I will see you all again next Thursday. Christopher",
