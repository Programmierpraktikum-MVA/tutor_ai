The info on ISIS about the exam registration procedure makes it sound like registration is already possible, only that it will be accepted or declined based on the homework criterion. However when I try to register via Moses it says that \"There are not any exams for this module in the selected semester.\"  Is this intended. Also, do I have to register for the seminar separately anywhere else? Thanks in advance! Kind regards Simon",
