[...].  To address this issue, a near-infrared reflectance value greater than 0.11 can be used to mask out water pixels so as to improve NDSI classification accuracy.  So in short, the intuition that we have developed during the class was quite correct, bright reflectance values can be confused with snow by the NDSI.  I hope this clarification can help in your understanding of vegetation indices.  Best, Tom",

If you registered before the dates were available, you were automatically assigned to the earlier date (01.08.2024). If this is not what you wanted, please deregister and register again. There is still enough time to do this if you do it right away. Registration will be open until one day before the submission of the first homework. Please register before 28.05.2024, 23:55. Otherwise we cannot accept you anymore for this semester. Please remember that you can only select one of the two dates. If you fail the first date, the second exam will not be your retake date. Instead, there will be a third exam date for retakes if someone fails. If you have questions or issues that are relevant to everyone, please write them in the forum. For personal issues please contact me directly. We will do our best to help you resolve the issues. Sincerely, Leonard Hackel - IP4RS Team",

Do we just substitute B and O with the terms in the table? If so, do we always select a single penalty (center, TV or boundary)? What do we substitute for \"Extremes\"? - Regarding tensor models (slide 17-18):     - Could you please repeat the idea. Is the advantage just interpretability (if yes, how so), performance or something different entirely?     - What do we call K?     - I don't know anything about CPD and Tucker decomposition. Is this relevant? - Regarding notation: Is there a meaningful difference between A and X? A seems to be used more for supervised and blind unmixing and X for sparse unmixing, however, in SUnSAL, SUnAA, and FASUN, A is used again. - Regarding SUnSAL (slide 19): What are D_h, D_v?  Generally, I would like to know which type of tasks we can expect (multiple choice, short answers, explanations, calculations, drawing, etc.) and if you have any example tasks for us. Thank you.",

                                    "Content": "Hi, 1- You don't have to memorize the formulas for unmixing models. You need to know the difference between three main categories, semisupervised, blind (unsupervised), and supervised. If you see a model you should be able to recognize if it is semisupervised, Blind, or supervised and why. For the NN models you should know the main concepts such as how to enforce the ASC and ANC what are the abundances and endmemebers. 2-B and O are given in the table should be substituted with in the LS-based optimization. It does not make sense to apply all Geometrical-based penalty at the same time. So one geometrical penalty is enough but you may apply penalties on abundances as well. Geometrical endmember based extraction/estimation techniques such as VCA and SiVM can be used for extracting extremes or boundary points. 3- Tensor models do not ignore the spatial correlation. Linear Mixing Model (LMM) works with vectorized data while Tensor Models assume HSI is a third order tensor. 4-CPD and Tucker decompositions are not interpretable for unmixing. You will not be asked about these two models. Because they are not explained in the slides. 5- X is a redundant matrix containing the abundances and often used for sparse unmixing but A is a low-rank matrix and can be used for all types of unmixing. 6-D_h and D_v are horizontal and vertical difference operators, respectively, for a vectorized image. But You do not have to know the details about them since they are not mentioned in the slides. For the exam please see the sample.",

Should I use all of them in my discussions? Also, when you say that the mAP should be added manually, does this mean we can not use sklearn or other libraries for this metric? thank you",

Nonetheless, you are required to train your model with all 4 methods.  2) Yes, please use at least the four metrics f1-score micro, f1-macro, mAP micro and mAP-macro that are inlcuded in the homework sheet. Briefly mentioning them and including them into a discussion in the report is then straightforward, I suppose. You can use the provided metrics from sklearn or any other preferred library.

So, for your case: You don't have to use band 8, but you can if you want. You should use band 8a in any case.  I hope this helps.",

For each pixel we calculate the distance to each reference point and classify it as the class it is nearest to, right? The closest distance might be still really large, but we can classify all pixels nonetheless. Should we assign the class \"Other\", if the pixel isn't close to any reference point?

Only upsampling is the correct linguistic equivalent of interpolation, but up- and downsampling are both called interpolation in software libraries such as pytorch. This is done for practical reasons, as from an implementation perspective, there is only a minor difference in downsampling (resampling with, e.g. scale 0.5, going from 120x120 to 60x60 pixels / going from 10m to 20m) and upsampling (resampling with, e.g. scale 0.5, going from 120x120 to 240x240 pixels / going from 10m to 5m).

I suppose the problem is that ISIS needs you to be logged in, in order to access the file (note that you are being forwarded to /login/index.php).  If you really want to download it via your shell you can also open up the Web Developer Tools inside your Browser, switch to the Network Tab. Once this is open click on the Download link to Lab01.ipynb on the ISIS page. You should be now able to see a GET request in the Network tab with status 200 (OK) for the file. Now you can go hit right-click -> Copy Value -> Copy cURL.  This will include the session-cookie (i.e. your login). Copying this into your shell and appending \"-o Lab01.ipynb\" (i.e., \"please output this into a file named Lab01.ipynb\") should download the notebook in a more hacky manner.  Hope this can help",
