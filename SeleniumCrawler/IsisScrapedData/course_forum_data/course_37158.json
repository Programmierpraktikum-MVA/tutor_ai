If you have not been selected, we will try to offer slots to more students in case selected participants cancel their registrations. Otherwise, you are welcome to try again next time.

If you have filled out the original survey, but want to change your answer, you can use the Repeat Registration Survey to submit a new answer. There, you can also update your answer after submission. Sadly, we cannot update this setting in the original survey. For the registration, we will take your newest submission on either survey into account. If you filled out the original survey, and are happy with your submission, you do not need to do anything. As announced before, we will complete the slot assignment on April 19 (Fri). We have updated the deadline of the survey to April 19, 8am, so that you have a couple more hours, but to be safe, please fill out the survey tomorrow! Also, there will be no lecture tomorrow, April 18 (Thu). Best regards, Nils Japke",

This course will start with a Kick-Off session at April 17, 16:15h (Wed), where we present all organizational aspects. We will have no session on Thursday this week, as you will still be filling out the registration survey at this point. The Kick-Off session (and the lecture going forward) will be held digitally via Zoom (Link: https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/68919616987?pwd=TWg4YUROMzRMbVV3ZUVQeGdhd0ZkQT09). As we have only limited seats available, we assign course participation based on a Registration Survey (starting after the Kick-Off). Please note that we want to announce the number of participants quickly, so the survey closes a day later at April 18 (Thu)! We will announce the confirmed participants on April 19 (Fri). The first lecture will be next Wednesday (April 24th). Best regards, Tim Dockenfuﬂ",
