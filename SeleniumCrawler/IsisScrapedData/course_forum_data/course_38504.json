However, when inspecting the pictures, it becomes clear that the test image should be an image of DG. I'm pretty sure that my code does exactly what it says in the instructions, and it is only a couple of lines in total.  Are there any guesses from the instructors what the reason for this could be? Or is this to be expected? Or is anyone facing the same issue?  Thanks Felix",
