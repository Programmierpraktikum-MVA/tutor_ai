I just want to note that not everyone in the same group will get the same grade. It still very much depends on the effort you have put into the assignment and your knowledge about the assignment content.  Please also try to focus about the issues we discussed during your demonstrations. Some general feedback: 1. For the groups who couldn't get the alignment done yet, please make sure to work on it and make your robots align in a cell at an acceptable performance. 2. Keep it simple, stupid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) first! Try to get some behaviors running quickly! Only then you will be able to understand the full extend of what you need to do. 3. Read the documentation and try to understand the examples on different components of ROS that you are using. Having a deeper understanding of what's going on under the hood will make your lives easier! 4. Your reports should explain your approach you took in order to solve the problems in the assignment. Some reports were really good, however, some groups should put a little bit more effort into the report. I already communicated this to those groups during demonstrations. The idea is, we should be able to read your reports and understand what you are doing. It shouldn't include all the details of course, but it shouldn't also look like some random notes you took during development process!  If you still have some questions or confusion about your grade, just email/contact me.  Best, Furkan  P.S I think a lot of the Akin's laws of spacecraft design apply to robotics too, maybe have a look at them (https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html) but don't take them too literally for this course!",

                                    "Content": "Hello everyone, First, a big thanks to Furkan for expanding, updating and especially building our lab's maze for the new assignment. Yesterday after the demonstrations, I spent time in the lab adding new features to our project and checking for bugs in previous code. Initially, the robot's localization functioned very reliably. However, towards the end of my lab session, I encountered a persistent localization issue. After a bit of testing I was even able to reproduce the issue reliably. Despite planning to leave the lab early, my curiosity led me to debug this issue. As this issue was reliably reproducible and our wall detection for each cell was spot on, I expected a fundamental issue in our localization implementation. This led me to increase our debug levels incrementally for a long long time, but with each debug level I still didn't find the Bug. Only late in the evening, after ramping up our debugging significantly, I was able to pinpoint the issue. Although Furkan thoroughly checked the new map file against the physical maze and even verified it with Team Green's visualizations and on first glance the map seemed accurate, creating such maps manually in a text file is obviously inherently susceptible to errors. The error involved a missing wall at the bottom of the maze. This wasn't immediately apparent since our robot didn’t attempt to exit the maze through the non-existent boundary as there is no neighboring cell it is allowed to enter, but it obviously disrupted our localization as it expected no wall there. As finding that issue took me way too much time and to ensure you don't need to spend time troubleshooting a non-existent code issue as well, I have updated the map file to include the missing wall. Here’s the corrected version for download: map.txt This might also be (maybe even more) interesting for you: Download Link Best regards, Tobias",

First of all, the documentation you sent is for ROS2, not ROS1, however there is the comparable actionlib (http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib) in ROS1. You are right about services would be used for some quick calculations/requests. I missed out on this in our assignment because I was focusing on something else, sorry!  I agree that waiting for the whole plan execution to end in order to return the service call is not ideal. So, I would suggest this to everyone instead: You can immediately return the service call, however, you should play a short sound/song on the robot when the plan is not achievable (aka the robots would need to jump over the wall to be able to execute the plan). Similarly, when the robot finishes its execution of the plan, it should play another sound/song to report success!  Best, Furkan",

You can install an Ubuntu version and start using it from the command line (it is also supported by all major IDEs so you can use it while developing your projects). After you setup WSL on your PC, you need to install the desired Ubuntu version from the Windows Store and configure your environment. It is quite easy to work on it after you set it up. The only important thing is that you install Ubuntu version 20.04 since ROS Noetic cannot be installed on newer versions. At least I could not make it work with the most recent Ubuntu version anyway :/ Disclaimer: I am a student and I do not know if the usage of WSL needs to be approved by the teaching body (this forum entry is also an implicit question). So, take my advice with a grain of salt :D",
