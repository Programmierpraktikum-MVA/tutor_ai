The evaluation is done on a basis of a poll for students. The link to the poll is: https://befragung.tu-berlin.de/evasys/online.php?pswd=7KDK1 At the next JF (28.06), I will give you some time to complete the poll, and if you are not(!) joining the next JF, please, fill it out online using the link. I would really appreciate some feedback from you! You can change the language to English by clicking the British flag in the upper-right corner.  Regards Andrei",

Please, do not forget that the registration deadline for the RaW project is 31st of May! Until Friday (31.06), please send me a one-page document with (1) your project title, (2) your considerations for the project with respect to the topic you have chosen and (3) a step-by-step project plan. The document is not graded and will not be used as a basis for grading later. On Friday (31.06), we will have a \"development kick-off\" where we will discuss how we proceed through the project development phase. I wish you a nice week and hope to see everyone on Friday!
