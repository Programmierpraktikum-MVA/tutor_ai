In case you are running into problems with your assignments and have questions, I will be ultimately available next Wednesday during the usual class hours from 10:15 to 11:45. This will be your last chance to get any advice from, as I will be out of the office and not available the next days. Some general remark: I asked you to submit a report of approx. 10 pages. In the second round I already saw some reports that had near to 20 pages (which is obviously too much), and also some with only 4 pages (which hints that you were a bit too brief). If this concerns you, please make an effort to compress or expand accordingly (and PLEASE NOT by changing the font size or similar).",

The workaround is to use the faster and more efficient 'Krylov' solver (which is to be preferred anyway). You can enable the solver by: right click on 'direct frequency response' (head of tree)  - > add solver -> Krylov right on KRYLOV (at the bottom of tree) and choose 'mumps sub-solver' The effect of this that the results get stored correctly AND the solution is faster.

It says \"Also, show the vertical directivity at the height of the center of the diaphragm at the dominant resonant frequencies\". Does this mean apart from the reference point 1m in front of the speaker (on-axis), we should run the calculation for a second point, at 1m distance as well, but rotated 90∞ upwards, so a point +1m in z-direction from the diaphragm center? And at the resonant frequencies means NOT the full frequency response like on the frontal point? If so, what else is asked for by this? Kind regards Felix",

At first I had taken a course in german but the topic was too difficult because of the language. At the moment, I am in discussion with my university in order to receive their authorisation to take this course.  However, is it too late to take part to this course ? I will take the time to fill the gap and study the courses of the 17th and 24th of April.   Best regards,   Astrid Croset",
