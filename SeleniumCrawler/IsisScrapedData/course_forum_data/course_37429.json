                                    "Content": "Hi all, Next two weeks (25 June and 02 July), there will be no lecture and we dedicate these two weeks for projects.  We prepared three fun projects for you to choose from. You may also propose your own project based on any other networking tools. Please discuss with us if you have a project idea of your own. Projects can be done in groups of size at most 3. Individual projects are allowed, but we request you to find group mates as far as possible. Please make use of the discussion forum on ISIS. Once you have chosen a project and formed a group, please enter your project details here (this data only stays within TU servers and will be deleted after a month): https://nextcloud.inet.tu-berlin.de/s/ejrNmsHc9kq9sdF ns3 project This project is within the context of large-scale distributed training of language models. Typically, GPUs are arranged in a CLOS topology and large model is trained in a distributed manner using all these GPUs. There has been much research activity both from Industry and Academia in the recent years, to understand the traffic patterns in such clusters and the underlying problems. This project gives a tiny glimpse of some of the issues arising from load-balancing (ECMP) and congestion control.   k-ary fat-tree topology with 128 GPU nodes (interpret these as servers). Every link has 100Gbps bandwidth and 500 nanoseconds latency/delay. The simulation setup is as follows: Workload: Choose one of the following traffic patterns for the project AllReduce: All-to-All communication i.e., every GPU has one transmission towards every other GPU in the topology. All transmissions have the same start time.  Scatter: Choose a GPU, say 64, then GPU 64 has one transmission towards every other GPU in the topology. All transmissions have the same start time. Gather: Choose a GPU, say 64, then every GPU in the topology (except GPU 64) has one transmission towards GPU 64. Transfer size: Choose one of the following for the size (\"MaxSize\" attribute) of *every* flow in your workload 8KB 32KB 64KB Transport protocol: Please refer to the example discussed in the lecture for queue disc and TCP configurations. Choose one of the following as your transport protocol. Set the buffer size to 100 packets. DCTCP: Set the marking threshold of RED queue disc to 20 packets RENO: Use FIFO queue disc Cubic: Use FIFO queue disc Once you choose a workload + transfer size + transport protocol, simulate the network in both the following cases: Per-flow ECMP routing: Config::SetDefault(\"ns3::Ipv4GlobalRouting::FlowEcmpRouting\", BooleanValue(true)); Packet spraying: Config::SetDefault(\"ns3::Ipv4GlobalRouting::RandomEcmpRouting\", BooleanValue(true));  Output: Log the completion time of each flow in your simulation and plot a CDF of the completion times. Compare the results for ECMP and packet spraying. Note: Completion time is the time it takes from the start time of a flow until the last packet of the flow has been successfully transmitted. As discussed in the lecture, please use ns3-datacenter repository for this project. Write your simulation code within the your own directory in simulator/ns3.39/examples/yourExample  P4 project As discussed during the lecture, in-band network telemetry is one of the techniques used by HPCC and PowerTCP that enables much more fine-grained congestion control in datacenters. In this context, there have been many research works on efficiently inserting the telemetry metadata in to packets (eg., TCP-INT, TCP's Third Eye).  This project gives a starting point for you with P4 programming, packet header field manipulation and telemetry. Write a p4 program that can insert telemetry data in to TCP packets. This technique is usually referred as in-band network telemetry (INT). Assume that the incoming packets have the following format. Every packet arrives with a TCP option initialized at the sender. This option has custom format as follows: First byte: Indicates the option number 250 Second byte: Indicates the length of this option i.e, 4  Third byte: Timestamp Fourth byte: Queue length Your p4 program has to insert the current timestamp in the third byte and the current queue length (corresponding to the output queue used by the packet) in the fourth byte.  Gurobi project Self-adjusting and reconfigurable topologies are a hot-topic in networking recently. In this context, optimizing the topology for the traffic that it serves, can significantly improve performance. Among others, the throughput of a demand-aware network can be significantly better than a static topology. You can take a look at some of the recent works at INET: demand-aware throughput bounds, Mars, Duo, Cerberus. Write a linear program in Gurobi to find the best (directed) topology that maximizes throughput given a demand matrix, and degree constraints for each node. The setup is as follows: There are N nodes, let this be a parameter and set it to any power of 2 value greater than 8 Each node has d outgoing links and d incoming links. Let d be a parameter and set it to any power of 2 value less than or equal to N All links have a capacity of 1 unit Choose any n x n d-doubly stochastic matrix i.e, the sum of every row and column is equal to d. For example:  - Uniform matrix: All values are (n-1)/d except the diagonal  - Permutation matrix: The entry in Row i, Column (i+1)%n has a value of d, for all 0<= i < n and all other values are zero Note: The above problem is slightly similar to the throughput maximization problem discussed in the lecture, except that the graph is not fixed. Your LP has to find the optimal graph. Here, nodes are fixed but you need to find the edge set.  Have fun :) We would like to remind that the project component is mainly a learning process, and it will not be graded. However, it would help in getting few extra points in the oral exam. If anything is unclear, or if you need any help, always feel free to contact us.   Thanks, Vamsi",
