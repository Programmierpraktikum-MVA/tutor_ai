We are going to meet at 9am in front of the ILR Building and prepare everything for the flight tests. Unfortunately we do not have a van to transport everyone to the airfield so we will come up with a plan on monday morning on how it would be best for everyone to get to the field.  Please remember to bring the following to the airfield:  Water Food Sunscreen A hat  Sunglasses  Your laptops I hope you guys have a nice weekend and see you all on monday morning.  Sutej",
