I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page: you are allowed to use ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) for coding. you are responsible for the quality and correctness of the results obtained this way. LLM code isn't always good. Use at your own risk.  You must disclose the use of LLMs for coding, and mark the respective code sections. This also applies if you modified the mode. In this case mark it as \"Adapted from [LLM] code\".  You must disclose as well if you use LLMs for hypothesis generation or model selection. The use of LLMs for data postprocessing is prohibited. Your code must work with the original data provided in the download. Please also disclose which LLM was used (e.g. ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, etc.). Best wishes Franziska Hess",

Unfortunately, since the field of Data Science is developing so quickly, textbooks become outdated before they are even published, so take everything with a grain of salt. Particulary, the Python examples in textbooks often don't work with the most recent versions of the used packages and require updating. And there is no chemistry-focused textbook as far as I am aware of, so you have to connect the dots between the textbooks and original literature yourselves. These books are good starting materials: P. Sarang: \"Thinking Data Science\" (2023): good introduction into the workflow, a few errors, Python examples already require updating in most cases. Github repository. Unlike traditional classes, websites are often better resources: E. Medina et al.: Webbook: Machine learning in chemical engineering: Machine learning techniques with a focus on chemical engineering Towards Data Science Website: not everything accessible, but more extensive resource than textbooks distill.pub website: more advanced examples in visual style with a focus on image processing. Some useful articles: A gentle introduction into graph neural networks Understanding convolutions on graphs Exploring Bayesian Optimization (was not a topic in the class, but you will encounter this in the literature) How to use t-SNE effectively Geeks for Geeks website: has an article about almost every method. Some recommended general readings: Feature Engineering Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction Types of Machine Learning Underfitting and Overfitting What Are Embeddings in Machine Learning? What is Generative AI? Scikit documentation: check this out if you are interested in the details and parameters of individual methods  Best wishes Franziska Hess",

Check out their FAQ page (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) if you are interested. Additionally, this stackoverflow thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55253498/how-do-i-install-a-library-permanently-in-colab discusses ways to set up an environment so that you don't need to re-install the missing dependencies each time.  Note: Google Colab assigns quota to the user, and will shut down your script after prolonged inactivity or a long runtime. It is probably preferable to write and run codes locally, and only upload the refined codeblocks and saved variables to the shared workspace. You can also use TUBCloud for file sharing.
