Should we hardcode L and dt in our script, since we are not loading in the yaml here? 3. Can we ignore the control limits from assignment 2 here, or should we do temporal scaling? 4. I am not sure which approach to implement for the car case. Should we first optimize to find the bezier path and then use the output path of the bezier optimization as input for the new optimization with dynamics constraints? Should the dynamic constraints be added to the bezier optimization? Or should we just calculate the u values with flattened dynamics from x,y values of the bezier path? As mentioned in a previous question, this approach will lead to small errors because of the discretization. Is this fine? Should we run the actions through forward dynamics before saving them? ARM 5. The goal is out of reach for the default arm with L=[1,1,1]. Should we hardcode some higher values like [5,5,5]? 6. What exactly do you mean by You can ignore collisions that are caused by the links. Since the bezier path is not in collision, we do not have to do any collision checks? 7. Is using just a simple IK function (with maybe some singularity jumps) enough as long as the end effector traces the bezier path? Or do you want a jacobian approach? I would appreciate a quick answer to these questions. Thank you in advance.  Best, Viktor",

Control limits should not be ignored, so please implement temporal scaling. 4. Ideally you use the differential flatness property, as the other suggested solutions are much more complicated. Small errors due to discretization are always expected and shouldn't affect our tests/grading. 5. You should rely on the parameters of the arm_0 case. You can move the goal location to be reachable for your own testing. 6. You should only execute collision checking for the end effector, not for parts of the arm with the environment. 7.

To set up the \"Benchmark\" object, a \"SpaceInformation\" object is needed. Only in the \"SpaceInformation\" object the Space Sampler can be set. The \"SpaceInformation\" is also needed for creating a planner. When adding planners to the benchmark object, it is required that the \"SpaceInformation\" object is the same. When updating the state sampler in one of the planners space informations, it updates for all the planners because they are pointing to the same instance, therefore making it impossible to change the state samplers before the tests start. The second possibility I found is to switch the state sampler before starting the tests with a new planner by setting the \"setPlannerSwitchEvent\" with a corresponding function. However, until now I was not able to get this function working. For all of the things I tried, which was passing some sort of functions to this, I get the following error:  did not match C++ signature:     setPlannerSwitchEvent(ompl::tools::Benchmark*, std::function<void (std::shared_ptr<ompl::base::Planner>)>)  Do you have any ideas how this function can be called or how we are supposed to perform the benchmark?

The planner switch function is exactly the right place to change functions in the SpaceInformation object including setting the StateSpaceSampler. However, I believe you might have not called the function in the right way from python. Here is a simple way of how you call it:  First, you need to define a function to change the sampler (there goes your logic for choosing samplers based on planner type/name).  def MyPreRunEvent(planner): planner.getSpaceInformation().setValidStateSamplerAllocator(.... your state sampler goes here....)  Then you need to tell this function to the benchmarker. benchmark.setPlannerSwitchEvent(tools.PreSetupEvent(MyPreRunEvent))  I suspect that you might not have used the PreSetupEvent? If this does not work, please post the line of code where you call the function.  Andreas",

This is probably not something you can fix yourself, but i still wanted to make you aware of the issue. I hope this gets resolved soon.  I saw that you are running the benchmark in the pipeline. Depending on the benchmark setup, this will block the runner for quite a significant time, so maybe you could remove it or let it time out or something.   For anyone that still wants to run the pipeline right now:  If you have docker installed you can simply open a terminal to your repository directory and run the following command:  docker run --entrypoint bash --rm -w $PWD -v $PWD:$PWD -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock gitlab/gitlab-runner:v16.9.1 -c 'git config --global --add safe.directory \"*\";gitlab-runner exec docker test'  Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32933174/use-gitlab-ci-to-run-tests-locally  This will pull the correct version gitlab runner image and should run all the tests in exactly the same way the tu gitlab does. This should give you a certain level of confidence that your job will complete when it is finally run on gitlab.  Best, Viktor",

Also I have a question regarding the stepwise and controls. dt is set as 0.1 in the .yaml file, but the controls are often applied multiple steps. Should we just safety the file the control once (and also just the \"end state\" after that control)? Or should we include the control x times with all the intermediate steps? Thanks, Hannah",

                                    "Content": "Hello, I first installed OMPL on my local computer and everything worked until the benchmark task. Here I had the problem that import ompl.tools as tools could not be imported (only this modul) That's why I'm currently using the Docker container. Here I discovered something that I don't understand at all and that cost me a lot of time.   If I first import OMPL in my script (for the robot arm) that I run on the container, I get collisions in the collision checks where no collisions occur at all. If I first import fcl and then ompl, everything works and only collisions are recognized if one occurs. Both times, however, the same fcl version is imported when I display the version: fcl version: 0.0.12  works: import fcl from ompl import base as base from ompl import geometric as geometric import ompl.control as control import ompl.tools as tools  does not work: from ompl import base as base from ompl import geometric as geometric import ompl.control as control import ompl.tools as tools import fcl   What could be the reason for this and what happens later in the test when the script is executed in a different environment? Also, I haven't received a rating for my Assignment2 (also exercise 6) yet. Is this still coming or has something gone wrong? I pushed it under the assignment2-solution tag. Many thanks for helping. Best, Nico",

Please understand that, due to the amount of submissions, we can't always double check this manually (because - as you probably can guess - there's many ways to name the tags, which is why we provide the name in the first place). I'll grade your submission manually now and add it. But that is an exception, so please make sure to name your tags correctly for assignment 3.  Best Pia",
