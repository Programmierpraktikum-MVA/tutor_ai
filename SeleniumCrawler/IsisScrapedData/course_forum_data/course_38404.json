They will be done using the beamer and from your laptops.   Additionally, if they are not needed for the presentation, you need to print your panels to hang on Thursday, following the distributed layout. If it is not possible to stick to the layout exactly, be flexible so that they can be placed on the wall for the final exhibition. The same goes for the A4 layout, which we will print on Thursday with what you send us.  I will ask Alexander if it is possible to have a screen or beamer on Thursday and Friday for our exhibition, so that those groups requiring it for videos, as communicated to me today, can use it. Please ensure that your presentation clearly outlines the project's problem or potential, your concept, the project’s objective, and how you plan to achieve it. Best regards and lots of energy for this final push.  Adela",

On Thursday, Jan Kampshoff, a guest professor from the department, will join us, and on Friday, Elena Lamata and Alejandro Guijarro from Fundbüro will be with us. All of them will also be present at your final presentation.  I recommend that your presentations, which will be projected on the wall, be as concise as possible to allow more time for discussion and feedback from the guest critics. Please bring your presentations in a digital form on your computer that we will connect to the beamer (if you have hand drawings scan them). The presentations will take place in our classroom, A513, so if there are small delays of 5-10 minutes at most, the next group can stay informed. During your classmates' presentations, you may work on your projects in the rest of the classroom.  Next week, on Thursday, July 11, we will not meet as I will be attending the final presentation of JZO, and on Friday, July 12, it will be our last meeting before the final presentation on Thursday, July 18.  For all subsequent presentations, the order will be as follows and will not change to avoid confusion and issues like last week:  - Group 1: 10:30-10:50 Melis, Dogu - Group 2: 10:50-11:10 Francesco, Riko, Joshua - Group 3: 11:10-11:30 Ece, Dogan, Beyza - Group 4: 11:30-11:50 Thalia, Artur - Group 5: 11:50-12:10 Luis Enrique, Hye-Sook - Group 6: 12:10-12:30 Antonia, Clara, Amarel - Group 7: 12:30-12:50 Yuki, Weinong, Emilio - Group 8: 12:50-13:10 Joel, Bridget - Group 9: 13:10-13:30 Jose Sinhue  I have been informed that your final submission of the portfolio, including improvements to the final projects based on the feedback from the final presentation, as well as the individual submissions A1, A2, and A3, will be due digitally on Friday, August 16. I will assign grades during the week of August 19-23, and they will be officially communicated by the department secretary to the university. You will then receive a digital Leistungsnachweis document by email to submit to your university.  Best regards and lots of energy to everyone,  Adela",

Please note that all these meetings until the end of the course are absolutely optional and are meant to support you in your designs whenever you need them. The meeting on Friday with Maria Hudl and me can also be held in groups and doesn’t have to be a common presentation for everyone, so you can use the rest of the time for your work. If you want to be removed from either list, just let me know and I’ll adjust the schedule accordingly.  For now, the order for the critique sessions with me in class on Thursday, June 27th is as follows:  - Group 9: 10:30-11:00 Jose Sinhue - Group 8: 11:00-11:30 Joel, Bridget - Group 7: 11:30-12:00 Yuki, Weinong, Emilio - Group 6: 12:00-12:30 Antonia, Clara, Amarel - Group 5: 12:30-13:00 Luis Enrique, Hye-Sook - Group 4: 13:00-13:30 Thalia, Artur - Group 3: 13:30-14:00 Ece, Dogan, Beyza - Group 2: 14:00-14:30 Francesco, Riko, Joshua - Group 1: 14:30-15:00 Melis, Dogu  For Friday, June 28th, the order of the presentations up to today is as follows:  - Group 9: 11:00-11:20 Jose Sinhue - Group 8: 11:20-11:40 Joel, Bridget - Group 7: 11:40-12:00 Yuki, Weinong, Emilio - Group 6: 12:00-12:20 Antonia, Clara, Amarel - Group 5: 12:20-12:40 Luis Enrique, Hye-Sook - Group 4: 12:40-13:00 Thalia, Artur - Group 3: 13:00-13:20 Ece, Dogan, Beyza - Group 2: 13:20-13:40 Francesco, Riko, Joshua - Group 1: 13:40-14:00 Melis, Dogu  Here are some references for the projects discussed on Friday in case you haven't found them:   - Arachnophilia: https://arachnophilia.net   - Roaratorio: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaratorio   - Fifteen Theses on Contemporary Art: https://chtodelat.org/b8-newspapers/12-69/fifteen-theses-on-contemporary-art/   - William Forsythe's Choreographic Works: https://ebin.pub/qdownload/entwrfe-und-gefge-william-forsythes-choreographische-arbeiten-in-ihren-architektonischen-konstellationen-1-aufl-9783839423776.html   - documenta X in Kassel: https://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen_documenta_X_in_Kassel_eroeffnet_2501.html   - Heiner Goebbels' \"Louis Andriessen: De Materie\": https://www.heinergoebbels.com/works/louis-andriessen-de-materie/357   - Heiner Goebbels' \"John Cage: Europeras 1 and 2\": https://www.heinergoebbels.com/works/john-cage-europeras-1-und-2/342/   - Ryoji Ikeda's Test Pattern (100m Version): (Light project with interaction from visitors) https://archiv.ruhrtriennale.de/www.2013.ruhrtriennale.de/de/programm/produktionen/ryoji-ikeda-test-pattern-100m-version/index.html    All examples about notation and scenic scores have been added to the literature folder under a specific folder called \"notation\":   - Graphic music scores - in pictures.docx   - Günther Uecker, Optische Partitur II, Prägedruck und Lithografie, 2014.jpg   - Jani Christou, Epicycle (1968), musical score (excerpt).jpg   - Ligeti, Artikulation score.webp   - ROBERT WILSON, The Score _ Ian Potter Museum of Art.pdf   - TheScore_Fusinato-791x561.jpg   - Tom Phillips, Six of Hearts.webp   - Uecker, Optische Partitur für Budapest, 2012, Lithografie, 105x78cm.jpg   - WILLIAM FORSYTHE    For the group working with letters: How to Do Things with Words by J.L.

Just for your information I attached a simple sketch showing how we are going to exhibit your work at this years Expo, all the work in the booklet, your model, your main drawing compiled on one A0 and some work via projection.

The Caring City: Health, Economy, and Environment by Izaskun Chinchilla Moreno. This book invites us to rethink architectural and urban models by prioritizing the public and civic dimensions of citizens' experiences, rather than the technical and formal knowledge sought by urban planners. It highlights how, after decades of industrialization, our cities have become productivity-oriented, often at the expense of non-productive activities like resting, accessing public toilets, drinking clean water without paying, or breathing unpolluted air. This focus on productivity has led to the neglect of the inhabitants' biological and subjective needs, turning this neglect into a cultural principle and political practice. \"The Caring City\" presents a broad range of alternatives that unify the economy, the environment, and the health of a diverse community.  2. Performance Spaces and Spatial Performativity: Theatre has left the building by Dorita Hannah. This chapter examines the evolution of theatrical space, from the enduring monuments of the 19th century, through the experimental sites of the 20th century, to the ephemeral and transitory locations of the 21st century. In this context, a deliberate lack of permanent home reinforces the community itself as a house. A \"death\" of enduring forms of theatre architecture is suggested, allowing for the emergence of more dynamic spatialities in contemporary European venues that offer alternatives to the traditional models of proscenium stage and black box studio. 3. Architecture and Disjunction and the article \"Architecture and Events\" both by Bernard Tschumi   I hope you find these texts interesting and useful. Best regards,   Adela",

I apologize for my selection of projects being quite Eurocentric, an error I would like to correct. The reason for this is simply that I am more familiar with this context.  There are two documents on the ISIS platform with all the devices identified by your colleagues to help you design your projects. The document is called ToBuildOrNot_Dispositive_240530.pdf and is uploaded in the Reading Material section.  The second new document is a compilation of 849 pages where we have gathered photographs of numerous pavilions and structures, some of which are already in the PIV research files or in the lectures, to serve as inspiration. You will receive it by email as it is too large to upload to the platform.  The results of exercise A2 are also uploaded to the Reading Material folder on the ISIS platform to help you with your projects.  The 3 students who did not present their PIV last week (Yuki, Francesco, Joel Adam) will be able to do so this Friday, June 7, at 10:30, and will have 10 minutes each. At 10:30, the presentations of the individual projects will begin and will end promptly at 14:45, so please bring food and drink. We will have 135 minutes, so each student will have 5 minutes for the presentation and one minute for comments, and we must be exact with the time. Please send the presentations before Friday at 9 am so that we can download them on our computer and not waste time connecting laptops.  I know that some students have already decided on their working groups on the ISIS platform, but you still have to present individual projects this week. There are 8 people still not enrolled in the groups and there are two groups with two people, which I don't know if they will end up being groups of three. Therefore, there are three groups yet to be formed. After the comments, you can finish or modify the formation of the working groups, which is your decision, and you must sign up on the platform before 8 pm. (https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/choice/view.php?id=1824760)  The order of presentation of individual projects is as follows: Melis, Jose Sinhue, Dina Amarel, Bridget Mary, Antonia Anna Martha, Joel Adam, Dogu, Clara Johanna, Francesco, Riko, Joshuah Emerson, Zeynep Ece, Dogan Yigit, Beyza, Taliia, Artur, Luis Enrique, Hye-Sook, Yuki, Weinong, Emilio.  The groups already formed are as follows: Group 1: Group 2: Francesco, Riko, Joshuah Emerson Group 3: Zeynep Ece, Dogan Yigit, Beyza Group 4: Taliia, Artur Group 5: Luis Enrique, Hye-Sook Group 6: Yuki, Weinong, Emilio Group 7: Group 8:  Tomorrow, Thursday, we have two lectures, at 10:30 by Wilk-Salinas Architekten and at 12:00 by Zuloark. In the coming weeks, we have two more lectures confirmed: Izaskun Chinchilla (probably on June 20) and Teresa Casas. It is not yet confirmed if Basurama will also give their pending lecture.  Next week, on Thursday, June 13, we will have a critic desk in class where each group can talk to me about the evolution of their ideas since the formation of the group and about possible adaptations of these ideas to one of the five chosen theater buildings or their surroundings. Each group will have 30 minutes to discuss whatever you want with me:  Group 1: 10:30-11:00 Group 2: 11:00-11:30 Group 3: 11:30-12:00 Group 4: 12:00-12:30 Group 5: 12:30-13:00 Group 6: 13:00-13:30 Group 7: 13:30-14:00 Group 8: 14:00-14:30  On Friday, June 14, each group will present the idea they have selected, and Benjamin Jagdmann, Baukoordinator und Technischer Produktionsleiter from Mecklenburgisches Staatstheater, will join us. Each group will have twenty minutes for the presentation that day:  Group 1: 10:30-10:50 Group 2: 10:50-11:10 Group 3: 11:10-11:30 Group 4: 11:30-11:50 Group 5: 11:50-12:10 Group 6: 12:10-12:30 Group 7: 12:30-12:50 Group 8: 12:50-13:10  Final project presentation: The institute is considering, for the exhibition of the final works, instead of simply having a Rundgang through the rooms where visitors observe the works, to have a schedule for each studio where students present their works. There will be a Schicht Plan to establish the times when at least two students must be in the room for fire safety. The exact times are not yet known, but it would be better if you reserve hours on Friday and Saturday for this purpose. The final presentation of \"To build or not to build: Architectural Innovations for Summer Spaces\" will take place on Thursday, July 18, from 10 am to 2 pm in room A513. On Friday and Saturday, I imagine that from 10 am to 8 pm there should always be two students present. There are 21 of you, so each one would be present for approximately two hours in the exhibition. When we receive the schedule, I will share it with you, bring it to class, and we will use this approximate list of schedules as a base to make a final one in which you can exchange times among yourselves if you wish.

A01a_Binn_Alexander / A01b_Binn-Alexander / etc. for the folders and so on for the files within the folders. There have been problems with some CAD-Files already uploaded, because some of you used no scale or different scales on one drawing without scale bar. So please check again wether your cad files have visible scales with which we can assure the right scale in-between all the cad files of you. For the CAD-Files it would also be great if people who are not sure wether theirs had a scale bar. As of today only 10 of you uploaded something to the final submission of A01. Here a reminder that only the students who upload their final version of their work at the A01 final submissions will get direct feedback by Adela.  And also regarding task A02 the work of the Volksbühne Group is missing entirely and for all the other groups at least the CAD files are missing, for some also the packed indesign.  Thx a lot and see you tomorrow! Alexander :)",

When you find the number of people your theaters can accommodate or the basic data in the list, please fill it in this Excel sheet, sorted by the year of completion.  I have responded to all the emails with questions. Tomorrow, I will be attending the IFA PhD Day at the institute, so I won’t be able to respond to any emails with queries until then. We will meet directly this Thursday at 10 am in the inner courtyard of Sophiensäle: [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7a3HFxT5aFV3jeZK7). At 1 pm, there will be a talk by Jan Kampshoff, who is the guest professor of our department and will be present at the final presentation of your projects in July.  Please upload the material related to all exercises to the corresponding folders so that I can continue providing feedback.  I have added a text to the Reading Material folder: Özel, Mehmet Kerem, Performativity of Theatre Architecture, 2017, Online Journal of Art and Design, and Dwyre, Cathryn, and Perry, Chris, \"Expanded Fields: Architecture/Landscape/Performance\", PAJ 109. These can be very helpful for some of the PIV cases and, in general, for reflecting on spaces that meet the flexibility required by contemporary projects. I wanted to extract the conclusion from the first text in this message because I think it can be a great inspiration for your design projects:  “Ultimately, what if, not within the delimitations of a conventional architectural inner space as given examples up to this point, but the building itself as a whole would be the physical manifestation of performativity? Once more, a collaboration between a theatre person and an architect, between Joan Littlewood and Cedric Price, gave a perfect answer to this question: The Fun Palace (1964) is an open, extendable overall structure with no fixed ground plan (Figure 12).” (p.80, Özel, Mehmet Kerem, Performativity of Theatre Architecture, 2017, Online Journal of Art and Design)  “Avant-garde theatre producer Joan Littlewood’s dream was to create a new kind of theatre of pure performativity and interaction (Mathews 2005, 75). Price’s solution was an improvisational architecture endlessly in the process of construction, dismantling, and reassembly with infinite variation and flexibility (Mathews 2005, 74). As Stanley Mathews (2005, 79) explains, the Fun Palace was “not a static and solid ‘building’, but a new kind of active and dynamic architecture which would permit multiple uses and which would constantly adapt to change. It would be a network of multiple events, a space of oscillation between incongruous activities simultaneously played out like some Dada performance. Spaces should be endlessly varied in size, shape, lighting, and accessibility.” Another important characteristic of the Fun Palace is that “since [its] program would be ad hoc, determined by the users, its behavior would be unstable, indeterminate, and unknowable in advance” (Mathews 2005, 81).” (p.80, Özel, Mehmet Kerem, Performativity of Theatre Architecture, 2017, Online Journal of Art and Design)  CONCLUSION: As can be noticed, most of the revolutionary theatre projects discussed in the context of performativity are unbuilt architecture. In this sense, rereading and reinterpreting black box type theatre architecture from a performative perspective could be stimulating for the future of theater architecture. Peter Brook (1968, 65), who stated that he had many abortive discussions with architects building new theatres, asks in his seminal book “The Empty Space”: “The science of theatre-building must come from studying what it is that brings about the most vivid relationship between people – and is this best served by asymmetry, even by disorder? If so, what can be the rule of disorder?” The clue to the answer to Brook’s question may be the performativity of architecture in the theatrical space among the performances of the actors and of the spectators.” (p.81, Özel, Mehmet Kerem, Performativity of Theatre Architecture, 2017, Online Journal of Art and Design) *Brook, P. (1968). The Empty Space. New York: Touchstone.",

We visited the Schaubühne, and the poster in the soutane had plans of numerous theaters, etc. \"Jill\" is just a shortcut repeated across many projects, meaning Jill has already found some information, which is why it appears multiple times.  For those whose case study has an \"S\" in front, you can insert a photo of the plans from the Schaubühne poster in the soutane if you cannot find another online or a higher quality one from the library. In the Reading Material section of the ISIS platform, you will find a PDF with Hana's presentation, which also includes material from some theaters. Best regards.",

However, if anyone wants to spend more time working on it, they could do so, and it will not affect their grade. This means they could choose to present at another agreed-upon time, either individually or in a small group. Of course, I would encourage you to try to present next week and complete this task. For most new cases, you simply need to find online the plans and a photo, and determine which type of theatre space they fit into, which is not a long task. If there are cases for which you find no information, then it is so. It is a superficial research, we do not dig into archives or visit libraries far away, so our research means are limited and is fine.   Next Friday, May 31st, if there is time left, anyone who wishes to share their initial project ideas, intuitions, or topics they are interested in working on can do so informally with the group. This will mark the beginning of our specific project brainstorming session. To ensure fairness, since some of your colleagues will only present their PIVs and might not have time to develop individual ideas, it would be best to delay the group decision-making until the following week. During that week, we will have a formal session to share our initial project ideas. Next Thursday, May 30th, at 10:00 AM, we have a visit to Sophiensäle, and at 1:00 PM, there will be a talk by Prof. Jan Kampshoff, the current head of our Department. On Friday, May 31st, at 10:00 AM, we have a visit to Ballhaus Ost, and afterward, we will return to the TU for the PIV presentations. Best regards, Adela",

This will allow me to provide feedback on these submissions for improvement before the final submission of the course portfolio.  I will share all the PIV cases with you via email. As you can see in the \"FOR STUDENTS_LIST OF CHARACTERISTICS\" Excel list, on the second page \"LIST OF CASE STUDIES,\" there is a list of all the theater buildings to be studied. For some, only a photo or a section is missing. You only need to draw the plans of the projects if you have an ORANGE case study! (This is why these people have fewer cases in PIV). For the rest of the new cases I am sharing today, you only need to find the plan or section if it is not already in the InDesign document, BUT DO NOT DRAW IT! Remember that you have a document with many of these cases already containing some information. If a page for your case does not exist, use a blank page to create one like the rest. For all cases, you need to create the relevant small theater type diagram. As I mentioned before, it would be good if you share these diagrams among yourselves so that each person only has to draw one.  The final presentation will be on Thursday, July 18th, from 10:30 to 14:30 (and not on Friday, July 19th, as previously stated) because Friday is the official setup day for the Jahresausstellung, a rule imposed by the IFA's expo team. Before the morning of the physical presentation on the 18th (you will hang your A0 panels in room A513 before 10 am, ideally the day before), you must have digitally uploaded the same panels in PDF and an A4 version of the presentation. There is a layout for both formats on the Isis platform.  The final submission of the course portfolio will take place one week after July 18th, on Thursday, July 25th. From July 18th to 25th, you can make improvements to the final projects based on the feedback received during the final presentation. Exercises A1a+b+c and A2 should already be definitively completed. Over the next three weeks, you will receive individual feedback on exercises A1a+b+c, the PIV, and A2 to allow for improvements before the final submission.  See you tomorrow at 9:55 at the entrance of the Deutsche Oper: Bismarckstraße 35, 10627 Berlin.  Best regards, Adela",

                                    "Content": "### Subject: Important Updates and Resources for Upcoming Assignments  Hello everyone,  In the ISIS literature folder, you will find many documents that might interest you. The book by Juliane Rebentisch on aesthetics in installation art is now available there, and it includes a chapter specifically dedicated to theatricality in installation works.  Some of you may not have received a response to the email I sent with you copied to the architects or creators from whom we are still missing plans. Enorme Studio and EEEstudio have already sent everything they have, and Zuloark will respond next week.  Regarding the PIV assignment, the difference between Cyan Blue and Magenta colored projects is not really clear. According to my email, both of these colors mean that we are required to find images, plans, and draw a scheme of the type of theater. Simply put, some projects already have more information in the catalog shared with you, so there is less work to be done. Here, as I mentioned before, is the information already gathered from the PIV theater building catalog. Here is the link once again: [PIV Theater Building Catalog](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YWmq-SFYgYmHhGvaol_GO3YR0yzri3vG).  For speculative or unrealized projects, it is best to always evaluate their characteristics as if they had been built.  In A2, when analyzing the building's deficiencies or sustainability issues, it is possible to do so from the perspective of materials and functional areas of the design. If you cannot fit all the information into one design, create more than one drawing. The shared templates for Exercise A2 are a model for you to choose which best suits the information you want to discuss. You can make variations in this template. There is no page limit, so use as many as you need. The final format is A3, and the requirement is to follow those layouts.  In section 5: “5. Type of Context offered by the Building. Can a project be carried out on the stage? Is there a black box theater? What other possibilities are there? In this section, you should analyze the building‘s deficiencies or issues in adapting to contemporary theater and other types of events. We‘re also interested in your study of previous projects that have posed a challenge to the architectural configuration of the theater,” you should not only write a text about these aspects. You can (and should) use diagrams or drawings on the plans to illustrate your ideas on these topics. Although possible theatricalities may have already been indicated in section 4, you can analyze the spaces and their characteristics that are not directly on the stage but where one of the projects from our extensive list of analyzed projects could take place offstage. If you want to combine tasks 4 and 5, you can do so without any problem.  **Type of Context Offered by the Building:** - Describe the surroundings and physical characteristics of the building. - Assess whether the building has adaptable spaces for different types of theatrical productions and events.  **Existence of a Black Box Theater:** - Verify if the building includes a black box theater. - Explore and describe other possibilities the building may offer for events and theatrical productions, such as outdoor spaces, multipurpose rooms, etc.  **Analysis of Building Deficiencies or Issues:** - Identify and analyze the building’s deficiencies or issues in adapting to contemporary theater and other types of events. - Evaluate how these deficiencies might affect the functionality and flexibility of the building for hosting modern productions.  **Study of Previous Projects:** - Investigate and study previous projects that have faced challenges with the architectural configuration of the theater. - Analyze how these projects addressed and overcame the challenges presented by the building’s design.  This exercise requires an analytical and detailed approach, using concrete examples and case studies to illustrate the points mentioned. The goal is to understand how the building can (or cannot) adapt to the needs of contemporary theater and what improvements might be implemented.  The buildings may correspond to one or several theatrical typologies. If needed, use the floor plans and sections to analyze the building's usage, not just to identify the types of stages they offer. After all, some of you may carry out projects in these buildings, and it is interesting to see how access and basic functions of these floors work.  The canceled Basurama talk will be rescheduled, although we do not yet know the date. This week, there are two scheduled talks: one by Isla Architects via Zoom at 13:30, and an in-person talk by Dr. Thea Brejzek, Professor of Spatial Theory at the School of Architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Bauhaus Foundation Dessau.  As I mentioned, on Friday, May 31st, we will present the PIV assignments. On Friday, June 7th, you will present your individual ideas so we can form work groups for the project. Starting Thursday, June 13th, all Thursdays and Fridays will be dedicated to project work and desk crits. One of your classmates would like to give a presentation on a project they participated in that relates to the course topics. I think it would be interesting to set a date for those who want to give more extensive presentations starting from that date. I propose Friday, June 14th for this purpose.  Best regards Adela",

Next week, you will receive more information on theatrical buildings to create the theater type diagrams. It would be more efficient if you could share your drawings of these diagrams with each other (and also with us) to reduce the workload. There are 21 theater type diagrams in total, so it would be sufficient for each of you to draw just one.  Thank you and have a great weekend!  Best regards,   Adela",

Please check your assigned cases in the PIV for any missing information, which is always highlighted in light red. If there are missing floor plans, sections, images, or details like the number of spectators, etc., this is the information you will need to include in the layout and also add here to complete the Excel document (leave the background color red). For those with a project marked in Orange: Study the case with layout A1. For those marked in Magenta: You need to search for the plans, images, and the scheme of the type of theatre. For those marked in Cyan Blue: You are only required to make the scheme of the type of theatre and search for plans, sections, and images. For those with buildings in magenta or cyan, you only need to make a simple scheme, so you will be assigned more projects. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l_OySNCRYZuyUqncFHCyvMJ1Dtdm475qJc2AsT9gZJg/edit#gid=1121799632 best Adela",

For those assigned a \"building\" project, a very simple layout is also uploaded in the PIV folder. You only need to select the type of theatre and fill in the corresponding section. For most buildings, existing floor plans, section images, and photographs are sufficient, and redrawing them is unnecessary. Thus, those working on this simpler scheme will receive another five buildings for each of these straightforward case studies to ensure equity with others who analyze the device, context, accessibility, and theatricality, and typically write a descriptive text. These categories include: 16. **ARCHITECTURE PROJECTS:** That deal with community, gathering, pavilions (something built, no performance). 17. **BUILT STRUCTURES THAT COULD HOST PERFORMANCES BUT ARE NOT MAINLY CONCEIVED FOR THEATRE.** 18. **THEATRE AND EVENT BUILDINGS.**  You will receive the full list this week, but you can start on the initial sheets and raise any questions if needed. Thank you, and please proceed accordingly.",

This will allow me to provide you with feedback. For those presenting this upcoming Friday, May 17, I assume you will upload your materials on that day.  At the end of the course, there will be a folder for submitting your complete portfolio for the semester. Please note, there will be no further opportunities for feedback on these exercises after submission.  For students undertaking the PIV exercise, your first assignment involves analyzing three projects in the same manner as the other A01 cases. You may use the same layout as A01a. For cases involving buildings where the theatricality section is not applicable, focus your analysis on the type of theater involved. I have emailed you a document with relevant information and also uploaded it to the literature folder, which could be useful for your designs.  A specific layout for building analyses will be uploaded this week, but feel free to proceed with your analysis using the existing format. Please remember to update the Excel list with the characteristics of the projects you have analyzed and those still pending (you can update this list even if you have already drafted the characteristics, which may change).  I will respond to emails before Thursday, in the order they are received.  Best wishes for a productive week,  Adela",

Please email me your work if you couldn't upload it to the platform's folder. Those who couldn't present today due to valid reasons will have a second chance on Friday, May 17th.   In the upcoming weeks, I will provide brief individual feedback on your A1a+b+c assignments via email, and you can make adjustments to improve your work. A new folder for final submissions will be created on the platform next week (feel free to send me your drafts via email before then).   Please remember not to change the layout colors! Some used green for context plans, which I understand, but it was not included in the color palette. Next week, we will provide you with consistent green and gray colors for everyone to use. The same applies to shadows—please avoid using them for consistency in the material (remove them from any device drawings that include them, and email me if you need clarification).  The characteristics section relates to the aspects analyzed in the \"List of characteristics\" Excel file and isn't meant for extensive project descriptions. The theater analysis assignment is due Friday in two weeks, so if you don't have a group yet (the selection folder is reopened), please check and contact your team for workload distribution.  I'm sending a shared email without blind copying so you can all have each other's email addresses, as we agreed today. The first PIV assignment is due in three weeks (one week after the building analysis submission), and there will also be a group presentation. You can always email me, and I'll respond promptly.  The device selected should be a constructed or material element, or the most architectural aspect. Some devices tied to performers are very relevant to certain projects, but we'll focus on the \"more architectural\" elements. For the third PIV assignment, some of you will work on buildings and will need a different layout, which will also be provided next week. If you're far along, you can study the building by Thursday (look for plans, sections, and understand the building).  In two weeks, after the location analysis submission, you'll have a week to prepare a pitch about the concept you wish to pursue for your project. We'll hold a session where you'll present your ideas to the group, which will help you decide whom to work with. It's logical to form groups based on shared interests, but the final decision is yours. Groups should consist of at least two and no more than three people, but I strongly encourage working in groups of three. Have a great weekend!",

Please send the emails to adelabravo@gmail.com so that I can read them from home as well. Don't forget that you need to fill in the crosses, dashes, or zeros in the Excel sheet with the characteristics for the projects. I've shared the Excel file via email so that we can all work on the same document. Completing this exercise might be tedious, but it provides you with insights into how different aspects of the project function.  For some characteristics, your projects may not exactly match what is described in the Excel sheet. That's why you can write down any specificities or doubts in the left column that make your project not fit exactly. This will make the document very long, but don't worry, it's okay. It's clearer to read your comments later than to only have dashes without understanding the doubts. For the description of the devices in the first 3 cases A01a and A01b, there isn't enough space in the initial layout, so now you have a page uploaded for everyone to write more extensively about the devices. The A2 exercise of site analysis in teams is already uploaded to the platform, although it starts on Friday the 10th in the afternoon. It has a layout as an example that you can use flexibly depending on how much text you have for each section or the size of the images. The A01c exercise has its layout uploaded to the folder on the A01c platform. As you can see, for the projects where you only need to analyze the device, you have to draw the project's floor plan and general axonometric, and then the floor plan and axonometric of the device only. There are two texts, one short with the project description and another longer one with the device description.  On Friday the 10th, we will have a presentation in class where each of you can talk about your analyzed projects. We'll have from 10:00 to 14:30, 270 minutes among 22 students, which means each of you will have only 12 minutes to talk about the devices from 5 projects.  best Adela",

                                    "Content": "Hello everyone, Only 11 people have uploaded exercise A01a to the ISIS folder. Please email me your work at adelabravo@gmail.com if you want me to provide feedback, or bring them to class this Thursday so we can review them. It would be good to bring exercise A01b to class this Thursday so we can go over it and address any questions. We'll have more time since the Enorme talk has been canceled.  Some clarifications about the exercise: PLANT AND AXONOMETRIC  The initial plant and axonometric always refer to the entirety of the project. In this case, you only need to make modifications to the plant and axonometric already provided to adapt them to the corresponding venue. For example, the Municipal Theater in My hands. My mothers. The axonometric and plant of the device must indicate its location within the project to avoid ambiguity. If the device is very small, consider including two images to show a zoomed-in view. Since the layout space is limited, if details appear too small, colleagues can refer to the original file for a closer look if the PDF appears crowded.  DEVICES  When naming devices, the goal is not to be poetic or creative with words, but to describe them scientifically—what they are, their function, contribution, etc. This approach aims for regulatory and design details irrespective of project themes.  What procedures occur in the project that differentiate it from a traditional theatrical event? How do spectators navigate differently, or what distinguishes these mechanisms from traditional theater? For example, if curtains are part of the project, how are they utilized?  Who can access the project and how? What boundaries are transgressed by doing so? Is access feasible for everyone? How can this idea be expressed physically for another author to use in a different thematic context?  What does it entail for spectators to view elements (objects, people, etc.) on stage as presented, and in the presented order, even in different modalities and their sequence?  CONTEXT  The context diagram comes first, followed by accessibility. Any template errors were addressed in the previous announcement. Accessibility and theatricality concern the entire project, not just your chosen device.  You can be more specific with your drawings, utilizing theater blueprints to depict projects and visitor access routes from the street. In the project My hands. My mothers., though the shared diagrams belong to the Institut für Angewandte Theaterwissenschaft in Giessen, adapting them for the Teatro Municipal de Coslada is feasible.  ACCESSIBILITY  In the accessibility scheme, focus on the entire project, including how your device interacts with accessibility. Indicate what is outside and inside, as well as intermediary positions. Different areas within the project may have varying degrees of accessibility. Can visitors access all areas at any time? Are all positions open to everyone? How close can visitors get to elements?  If the legend provided for theatricality seems inadequate, feel free to adjust it while adhering to the color palette. Include it in the drawing for clarity. A legend aids specificity in your drawings, conveying ideas visually and reducing reliance on text.  Theatricality pertains to the entire project with its different areas. As changes occur based on scene or sequence, aim to showcase as many theatrical elements as possible. Additional plants may be necessary, but if they don't fit well due to space constraints, colleagues can refer to the original file for details.  Best Adela",

My mothers per email. I have uploaded three texts to the 'Reading Material' folder. They are: \"Theatrale Übergangsräume: Black Box, White Cube und Stadtraum als Orte der Aufführung\" by Annett Lang, which is in German but can be translated with AI and is very relevant if you are studying the differences between black box spaces, white cubes, and urban spaces as venues for theatrical performances.  Also, I've uploaded a text by Elena Tavani titled \"Theatricality in Installation Artworks: An Overview.\" Lastly, another text by Lenka Nováková titled \"The Scenographic Unfolding: Performance of Immersive, Interactive, and Participatory Environments.\" I have Juliane Rebentisch's excellent book \"Aesthetics of Installation Art\" in the department but haven’t been able to scan it yet. The chapter on theatricality from pages 21 to 73 is particularly relevant, although the entire book would be very beneficial for us.  I was pleased to see some students at the \"RADICAL PLAYGROUNDS: Ein Kunstparcours am Gropius Bau\" on Saturday and Sunday. I highly recommend it to everyone as the theme is very much related to our research. best Adela",

For the rest, please upload them by this Friday, April 26th, so I can provide feedback. There are some recurring aspects that I want to address: you should give a name to the device you identify, and in the text, you should describe exactly what that element does, how its construction or installation influences how the project is used, or how participants can perceive it, or how they can gather around it. Why does it help to facilitate interaction between actors and spectators in a special way? How would the project function differently if this element were not present? Try to be as specific as possible. If you need more space to express yourselves, you can send the texts via email and write a summary in the layout.  In the theatricality diagrams, if the performance has different stages, it would be helpful if you indicate the stage you are analyzing. It would be even better if you could either mark several phases on the same plane or create smaller plans and highlight the changes in theatricality.  In the context plans, it would be good to indicate at least a couple of streets outside the building and where the project site is located within the building. Provide your own legends to help us understand the drawings if necessary.  Regarding accessibility, you can reflect more deeply than just indicating an arrow. How accessible are the spaces within the installation and the installation itself? Is the project porous or very closed? Is it architecture that provides access or not to the visitor compared to others? What are you basing your answers on to these questions?  Specifically in the Meat project, the project was actually created by Theda Bo Nilsson, as the author changed her name. Please update this information.  Regarding the floor plan, the project was located inside the Studio, which is not the main building of the Schaubühne but rather the building opposite, which functions as a black box theater. There is an error in the plan because although there is an opening, access to that hallway was only possible through the west opening, so you can draw a door to close the other opening if you wish. best Adela",

I repeat, tomorrow, Wednesday, you don't have to submit the complete analysis exercise of the first case study at 9 am if you haven't completed it. But by submitting it, you have the opportunity to receive my opinion or to write any doubts to me in a separate email.  This Thursday, April 25th, from 10-12, there will be an input session led by me regarding the remaining case studies for this first exercise, along with a brief theoretical input. I have divided the case studies which I will provide in class so that each student can work on the tasks you have done with the first 4 case studies. Then, at 12, there will be a presentation by Wismar students for you via Zoom.  This Friday, April 26th, at 11:45, there will be a guided tour of the theater that Wismar students will be studying for their projects, and you are invited if you wish to attend. The address is Alter Garten, 2, 19055, Schwerin, Mecklenburg State Theatre (with Wismar students). It takes 2 hours and 45 minutes from the architecture building, so you would need to leave here at 8:30. If you plan to attend, please write to Rubén Jódar (ruben.jodar@hs-wismar.de) so he can include you. https://maps.app.goo.gl/jy7a2sTXQWgD9BNy8 I will not be attending the visit and will remain at the TU in case anyone has doubts or wants to have a desk critique (those interested, please write to me on Thursday after class to create a schedule for Friday).  Floor plan context Information You only need to indicate the approximate situation of the project inside the buildings, if it is placed on the stage or inside a space that is a black box situation, the entrance and exit paths from the street, and those general access details.  You have information about the theatre buildings Schaubühne and Volksbühne in a drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EI-UIPWdZpluWE7nTCodmtc6VSRIKcjS?usp=sharing  Meat: The information to perform the floor plan context is that the Meat project was located inside the Schaubühne Studio, which is situated in front of the main building. Its entrance is through number 155, and the floor plan is in DWG in the folder with information about the theaters (Studio Grundriss): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EI-UIPWdZpluWE7nTCodmtc6VSRIKcjS?usp=sharingThe entrance corridor corresponds to the wall of the Studio's limit, and the services are already outside the project. You only need to indicate the approximate situation of the project inside the studio, the entrance and exit paths from the street, and those general access details.  In the cases we don't have plans from the buildings please check in google earth and make a simplification from the buildings: Mousonturm theatre in Frankfurt for Love Fiction that took place on the second floor:  https://www.mousonturm.de/  Teatro Municipal Coslada en Madrid https://www.redescena.net/escenario/3123/teatro-municipal-de-coslada/)  for My hands.My mothers that took place on stage at that venue (this project also happened inside other venues like Teatro Pradillo in Madrid, Instituto Cervantes in Madrid or at the Probebühne at the Institut for Angewandte Theaterwissenschaft in Giessen in Germany but the first venue is the best one. Answers added 15:30: The final submission of Task 1 is next Thursday, May 2nd. Whether a presentation will be held is still to be confirmed, depending on the time required by the visit and the talk scheduled for next week.  The project title is as given by the authors: \"Meat, Coming Society, My hands. My mother's, and Love Fiction\"; you don't need to create a new title. If you have a good idea for a subtitle, you can add it in the description.  The exercise for next week will also be individual. The analyses for this week and next are not relevant for the formation of the groups that will be formed later on.  The project's location remains the same; you don't have to think of a new one. This is still an analysis, not a new design. You should be creative or simply thorough in understanding the project, scrutinizing its details.  I hope I have answered all the questions.

Meat took place inside the studio at the Schaubühne and we don't have plans from it but from the main building. Coming Society took place inside the Volksbühne and we have drawn just the main Saal but not the rest of the building.

The room will not be completely dark, and Veronica is concerned that some of the projections may not be visible in detail. Therefore, if you wish, you may bring your laptops to view the screen she shares in class. Alternatively, you can always review her drawings online afterward.  Following the presentation, we will have a five-minute exercise in class for which you will need paper and a pen. Then, we will return to the classroom to review the Aufgabeblatt A1a, which is uploaded on the platform, and discuss a concept related to the exercise. I will be using another computer today as the one from the department is definitively experiencing issues. Therefore, there should be no problem with the Zoom transmission today (using the same course link provided below, which you can save).  For those of you who have not yet submitted the signed data document, please do so as soon as possible, and make sure to fill in your enrollment and course details in the document uploaded to the platform. Thank you very much.

Afterward, I will present the first exercise, and we can clarify any doubts about the material you will receive on Thursday, which you must study for Friday. All materials will be distributed and collected through the platform ISIS. Students who wish to remain in the course must provide (through ISIS) their student ID number, a valid email address (please confirm receipt of this first email), their study program (\"Studium\"), and the area of recognition (\"Anrechnung\") (optional elective / free choice / as an additional module), as well as sign the confidentiality documents (through ISIS).
