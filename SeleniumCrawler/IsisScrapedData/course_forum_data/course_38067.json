Additionally, the Zoom link, detailed instructions, and a short practice exam to help you familiarize yourself with the interface are available on ISIS.  Best regards, Florian   Before the exam - Try out the test exam to see which question types will be used and if it works fine on your setup - Make sure to have an operating camera and the latest version of the Zoom client - Make sure to use your laptop with a charger - Join the Zoom call https://us06web.zoom.us/j/85612812759?pwd=w5QTrR1mpFljLs76PJPsIQcDMJuEYd.1  (from 15:45 p.m.) - Upload the „confirmation of exam requirements“ form on ISIS before 16:00.      Without the confirmation form, you cannot access the exam!  During the exam - You can start the exam at 16:00, from that on you have 60min to finish the exam - Stay in the main room of the Zoom call - The exam is auto-saved with every page change and after every minute. You can also manually save longer texts. In the event of interruptions (e.g. Internet failure, accidental closing of the browser window), you can continue at the point of the last storage - If you have questions/problems raise your hand in Zoom and we will move you to a breakout room - in case of technical problems take screenshots as evidence  After the exam - Do not de-register from this ISIS course. If you do, we can’t evaluate your exam  Attempts at deception include, but are not limited to: - Working together on the exam - Conducting the exam with outside help - Persons other than the registered student conduct the exam",
