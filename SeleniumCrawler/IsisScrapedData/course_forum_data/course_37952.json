I guess we use Markov to obtain $$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = q(x_t | x_{t-1}, x_0)$$ and Bayes for $$q(x_t | x_{t-1}, x_0) = \\frac{q(x_{t-1} | x_t , x_0) \\cdot q(x_t | x_0) }{q(x_{t-1} | x_0)}$$?  Does the forward diffusion process assume a markov chain?   But I'm not 100% sure. The whole derivation seems quite constructed to me. I mean I can follow the steps but I'm not quite sure of how someone would come up with the specific steps. But maybe you have a deeper intuition for that :)",

                                    "Content": "Aah okay, now I understand.  1. Yes, Markov property and Bayes rule are the 2 two tools used for that transformation. That it is a markov process is mentioned on slide 19/30 of the lecture, just to reassure.  2. Yeah I also find this step to come a bit out of the blue as if it would be normal to just incorporate variables that aren't really dependend under the markov assumption. And sadly I cannot give you any intuition on that as I don't have it myself. I think oftentime when such derivations are made, the people doing them already intuitively have all the transformations in their head and just bring them to paper somehow, or maybe they just try to apply some transformations until something practical happens haha. In the case of this excercise though, its a bit easier. You have the result given and just need to apply transformations to get to the final solution. If you know, that you somehow need that $$ x_0 $$ there, but can't find it your current step of transforming the equations, now you have learned that you can just include it using the Markov assumption. Think of it maybe as an addition to the toolbox of mathematical transformations that you can use to get from A to B, just as the Bayes rule.  Here is a resource to dig a bit deeper: 1. https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/#reverse-diffusion-process (I generally recommend this blog) 2. mentioned in the blogpost, the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585  Sorry for the unsatisfying answer! In case this is something you are really curious about, I can check with the lecturer and maybe get some deeper intuition to be shared here.",

But alright. Third and biggest issue I have is that the first task is for example just a sentence plus this comment:  # TODO implement the forward diffusion process - 10 points # it takes the clean images, the noise and the timesteps as input and returns the noisy images  So we implement in this task the alpha and beta schedulers to add the noise on the images? Then it would be nice to have maybe a hint on the paper or that this is really the task. Because for sure we could use as well the diffusers DDPMScheduler and .add_noise(). So what is the real task?  I am sorry but this topic is so cool and even in a notebook for a homework assignment one could do really cool things with Diffusion Models but in this case I am disappointed from the love with which the task is assigned.

The two following tasks, namely implementing DDPM and DDIM and comparing them are a bit more understanding. Of course one could always have better and cooler tasks, but the point of this lecture is not doing fancy very advanced state of the art things with diffusion models, but to give you a basic understanding what happens there, but of course we can do more tricky less straight forward programming tasks in the exam if that is what you want ;)",

Of course that will never have influence on the level of the exam and justified critic is of course always welcome. However, in past exams there were a lot of people not able to solve the most simple programming questions and not everyone has a strong background in computer science who is attending the lecture. If you are really convinced in the majority that our programming exercises are too trivial you can write that in the evaluation, then next year we will hopefully change that, despite the fact that last year there was no such critic.  Furthermore, I still do not even really understand your critic. If I would directly write you the formula for the forward process in diffusion models there without you thinking a bit about the context of what you are doing, maybe recapitulating the lecture slides and maybe look into the there cited DDPM paper for more details, then what would you learn? Furthermore, it is only the first task and there are two more and the point is that you play around a bit with diffusion models without us directly giving you the notebook, but instead forcing you to fill in crucial parts that hopefully make you understand better what happens under the hood in diffusion models.  Lastly, your whole critic is very little constructive beside the hint that we could introduce checkpointing. What would you like us to do to make it faster if you have neither a GPU nor you are willing to use Google Colab? (which should be not that hard if you have a jupyter notebook or am i wrong?) What other parts of the pipeline should we do as fill-ins if not the crucial forward and reverse steps of the diffusion models, which are the core essence and also the point where they vary between each other a lot and where novel architectures like flow matching or consistency models also still improved? Especially, the sentence \" in this case I am disappointed from the love with which the task is assigned\" after so little justification what else would be better is not constructive critic, but harsh judgement.

To the second section: I agree totally with you and like your viewpoint on how we as students should do the assignments.  To the third section: I would like to apologize again on my harsh judgement. That was not goal-oriented. You are right. My suggestion would be to implement the forward diffusion process and then let us visualise at different time steps the noisy images. So we study the idea of schedulers and the forward diffusion process. If I got it correct then you could assign the further task like, \"training of those models is highly compute intense, therefore we load a pretrained noise prediction model with which we implement then the reverse diffusion DDIM and DDPM.\" Could this be an option for the future?

I was already confused why you are referring to the fact that the task is just to trivial while at the same time demanding that i directly tell you how to do it exactly.  If you attend the exercise session you will also see that in fact in the solution of the notebook there will be visualizations of the noisy images at different noise levels and visualizations of the x0-predictions at different noise levels and how they will improve when continuing training. Would it be more helpful to directly give you this as well? I thought you will play around and do such visualizations yourself anyway and it would just clutter the code if i do not explain what i did there.

I this case the Transition between state s' and s^(t) is multiplied onto the controlled reward function (immediate reward) which consists of sum over pi(.) and R(.) and onto the expected discounted value of the successor state. But as I understood it correct the sum over T(.) should be just multiplied onto the term with the discount factor gamma. Another hint that there might be something wrong in the slide is the Bellmann Operator: v^pi = r^pi + gamma * T^pi * v^pi. I hope that I stated my question clear. Best, Cederic",
