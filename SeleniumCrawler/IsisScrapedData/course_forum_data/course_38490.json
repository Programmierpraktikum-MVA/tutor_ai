To give you more time to prepare, the exam will open on Monday 15.07 in the morning, and you will have one opportunity to take it, until closing on Friday Afternoon that week. Regarding the video presentations, please upload your work to the TUBcloud folder by 15 July. Also please submit the slides on the ISIS submission tool, for grading For any questions,  I remain at your disposal.  Sincerely,  Dorian",

These sessions are intended for an interdisciplinary exchange and a tutorial examination of the course content. The course content is available through ISIS. You should look through the lecture slides and the recorded video lectures from previous years to acquaint yourselves with the themes we are examining week by week. The second half of this course will be conducted with Dr. Tristan Petit, on the topic of spectroscopic characterisation of nanomaterials - one of the most important aspects of this branch of materials science.
