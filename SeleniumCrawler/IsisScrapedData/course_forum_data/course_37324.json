If you are interested, just send me a short text and I will add you to the group or just respond to this thread. My number is: 01523 389 4119 Until then and good luck studying, Vincent",

In the first part of the Exercise Session you will be provided with some theoretical groundwork on a (partly) new topic, which you will then be asked to immediatelly apply in a Programming Contest! If you like the idea of a programming contest and want to participate make sure to bring a machine which has the programming language of your choice as well as some tool to solve LPs (like SCIP) installed and configured to your liking (If you did the programming assignments last year this should already be the case). The contest will not be super serious and you can also work (and compete) in groups or support each other, as long as you can agree on how to split the prizes, if you win ;) That's right, as it should be for a contest, there will be prizes! If you don't want to participate in the contest you can still attend the exercise session for the theoretical part at the beginning and/or to cheer up and support your favorite competitor. Best regards and see you friday, Chris",

As always, the material in the exercise session is different than the homework sheets. - 13 & 16 May: Christoph Spiegel is not in Berlin, the lectures of that week will be recorded and uploaded to ISIS. Besides this, the exercise session and tutorials are as usual. - 20 May: This is a public holiday and therefore the two tutorials of Chris are not taking place. If you have the possibility, feel free to come to my tutorial on the 17th instead (after the exercise session). The lecture on the 20th does not take place or is replaced in any way, either.

In particular, the tutorials on Monday will always correspond to the tutorial on Friday the week before, see notes in the exercise session for a more rigorous explanation. Other details about homework can be found in these notes as well. The sheet to be discussed in the first tutorials, consisting of non-homework exercises only for this time, is out. Feel free to take a first look at the exercises; however, they will not be graded. The first homework sheet, to be submitted by Tuesday, 30.04., will be uploaded by Tuesday, 23.04.

For those who have missed the first lecture, we have two announcements: 1. Please do not forget to sign up to a tutorial via Moses by 6pm tomorrow (17.4.).  If you do not have a Moses account (e.g. because you are from another university), send me (Ekin, ergen@math.tu-berlin.de) an email with times where you are available, so that you can be assigned manually. You can also do this after the deadline; indeed, it will be easier since we will know the exact times of the tutorials. The same applies if you see this message after the deadline. 2. We have decided that the lecture on Thursday as well as the exercise session on Friday each start at 8:30 and end at 10. Further announcements will follow on Friday during the exercise session. All the best, ADM II Team",
