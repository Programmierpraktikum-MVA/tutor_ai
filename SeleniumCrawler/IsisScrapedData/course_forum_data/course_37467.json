Please still come to lecture today, we are still hoping another person might show up, then the seminar will take place. However, if not, we will have to cancel the course for this semester as vital parts of the portfolio exam cannot be executed. So, unfortunately, I cannot give you a final answer to your question until today afternoon. So sorry!  Best, Marie  P.S. If you decide not to come, please write me another short message here.

Maybe you can set in the future the deadline for signup in Moses before the first assignment is due?

You could try again in the winter, usually there are at least about 8 people during that semester, and most topics usually stay the same. Then you could reuse your previous work from this semester.
