Attendance is mandatory (your presentation is part of the grading) and all of you want to have a respectful audience. In total, we have 13 presentations of 10min each (~130min total + 5min break). In order to avoid loosing time switching teams, we use the following process.  1) Upload of Presentations: All presentations will be given from my laptop, and I bring a pointing device to advance slides. In order to prepare everything before the lecture, please upload you slides as powerpoint (PPTX) or PDF to the following nextcloud folder (with the name XX_PPDS_DAMS.* or XX_PPDS_D2IP.* where XX is your team number) by July 07 EOD:  https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/GqmsdBWCJqDk8KG  2) Ordered Seating: Furthermore, to avoid a scramble when switching teams, please follow the following seating scheme (so entire teams can stand up or sit down).  * Row 1: for teaching assistants / lecturers * Row 2: DAMS 01 (left from entry), DAMS 02 (right from entry) * Row 3: DAMS 03 (left), DAMS 04 (right) * Row 4: DAMS 05 (left), DAMS 06 (right) * Row 5: DAMS 07 (left), DAMS 08 (right) * Row 6: DAMS 09 (left), DAMS 10 (right) * Row 7: DAMS 11 (left), N/A * Row 8: D2IP 01 (left), D2IP 02 (right)  3) Presentation: You have 10min for presentation and questions. We recommend to do 8+2min but to have at least 1min for questions, I'll strictly interrupt your presentation at the 9min mark. How you split up the speaking/answering time among yourself is up to you, but it would be good if not just one team member does all the talking.  We are looking forward to your presentations.

Könnten Sie bitte zu diesem Teil der Kursorganisation Auskunft geben?  Falls die Gruppen/Sprachen zugeteilt werden, würde ich sie auch um Auskunft zur Möglichkeit des Gruppenwechsels und Sprachwechsels bitten.  Es würde mich freuen, von Ihnen zu hören.
