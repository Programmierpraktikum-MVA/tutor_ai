Im Rahmen des Kurses \"Spacecraft Operations\" [1] erleben Studierende die operationellen On-Orbit Projektphasen des bereits 2021 gestarteten TU Satelliten TUBIN nach. Dabei sind sie ab Erstkontakt, bis zum Semesterende eigenständig für den Betrieb des Satelliten verantwortlich. Nach wochenlangen Vorbereitungen und Kennenlernen des Satelliten, „startet“ am Freitag, den 31.05.24 14:20 Uhr erneut die Transporter-2 Mission mit einer FALCON 9 Rakete, um TUBIN ins All zu befördern; dieses Mal unter dem Namen 2BIN. Nach Auswurf des Satelliten von der Raketenoberstufe, wird im TU Berlin eigenen Raumflugkontrollzentrum dem Erstkontakt entgegengefiebert. Das Launch Event wird aus dem Kontrollzentrum heraus gestreamt und von Kursteilnehmenden moderiert. Dabei wird präsentiert, wie sich auf den Satellitenbetrieb vorbereitet wurde und der nahende Erstkontakt mit dem Satelliten ablaufen wird. Der Stream [2] startet Freitag, 31.05.2024 ab 13:45 Uhr auf dem fachgebietseigenen YouTube Kanal [3].

You will join a team of other working students and have the possibility to plan your working time flexibly. The office is located near the S-Bahn station Babelsberg in Potsdam, only 27 minutes by S7 from Zoologischer Garten, but after a short training you will be able to work remotely. Depending on your academic background, you may also be involved in other areas in the future. This includes possible topics for a Bachelor's or Master's thesis. This is a great opportunity to get your foot in the door of a growing industry with exciting prospects such as space debris laser ranging and satellite laser communications.   We would particularly like to encourage students who are still in their undergraduate or early postgraduate studies and are looking for long-term employment to apply to us. A working week of 14 to 20 hours is expected.   Please see the attached job advertisement for more information. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or hr@digos.eu. If you would like to apply, please send your application to hr@digos.eu.   Best regards, Sebastian Herrmann Working student for DiGOS",
