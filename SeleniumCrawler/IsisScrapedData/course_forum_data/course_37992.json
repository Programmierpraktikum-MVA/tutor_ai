Meanwhile, I wanted to share a link with you for a 10-minute survey on estimating one's own carbon footprint, run by my close colleague Jonas Ludwig. How about you all take part in it and we can look at the results together when we meet on 25.5? It would be fun to see how we estimate the climate footprint of our own behaviors and see what we can learn from it.  Here is the link: https://thetulab.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_exhJ9DWskRYbVA2 Thanks and have a great rest of the week.  Lubna",

Since there have been some requests for a remote session on Saturday combined with a feeling that you could all use a bit of a break from intensive long weekend blocks, I decided to change the plan for Saturday.  Therefore, instead of meeting early on Saturday morning to assign groups then have you sit with your fellow team members and brainstorm a possible project topic, I decided to assign the groups now already, so you have time to meet within your groups at your own time (which could still be Saturday morning if you wish). We would then meet on Saturday at 12:30 pm online, and it is enough if 2-3 people per group are present if some of you definitely need to be somewhere else that day. I still would like to see as many of you as possible, but there is no mandatory presence. Those who are present will thus speak on behalf of their groups. We would only meet for a maximum of 1.5 hours, where each group would share how they think they might tackle their assigned problem and get feedback from me and other students. I hope this is a good compromise.  The meeting link is: https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/4400764112?pwd=RjVhN1VOaTIxb245Mzlxa2tZTk95UT09  Your groups assignments with suggested overarching topic(s) are as follows:  Education; Empowerment; Community Nature; Climate; Biodiversity Fake News; Media; Polarization Resources; Artificial Intelligence; Pollution Marieke Melina Sascha Omed Pauline Fabi W Yasmine Mohammed Dilara Samah Fabi H Jolina Syuan Yang Jakob Yerin Evrim  If you feel like you really want to work with a different group or on a different topic, please let me know asap. I cannot guarantee being able to change anything, but I would at least try...  P.S. The next yoga session is on Sunday is at 12 pm in Gleisdreiek Park. If anyone wants to join, email me and I will send you a link with the exact location. You'd need your own mat.  All the best, Lubna",

I have decided to share the actual agenda on Saturday morning rather than earlier. Each of you has a 1/17 chance of being the first presenter, so be ready! Also, please note the updated schedule: Saturday 27.4: 9:30-14:30 with a long lunch break in-between and another shorter break. We will have 10 presenters on Saturday. Please be on time to help set up the room and to discuss the schedule together. You will start presenting at 10. Consider bringing a snack or lunch with you since the MENSA will unfortunately be closed. Sunday 28.4: 9:30-12:10 with one short break. We will start at 9:30 sharp, so please be there on time. We will have the remaining 7 presenters that day. Attendance is compulsory for all of you for both days. Even if you present on Saturday, you are expected to attend on Sunday and actively participate! Each of you has a total of 20 minutes; your presentation takes 6:40 minutes (do not forget to time your slides; very important) and the rest of the time will be for discussion and questions. Please all send me your presentations by 8 am on Saturday morning 27.4. Wishing you the very best during your preparations and I am excited to be inspired together. Best, Lubna",
