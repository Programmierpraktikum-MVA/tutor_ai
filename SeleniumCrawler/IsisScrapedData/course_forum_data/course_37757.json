We can use this as a digital feedback platform until we meet again next week. I will look into the Ether pad and comment/answer questions this Wednesday afternoon around 2pm and again next Monday afternoon around 2pm. For our next session on May 16th, we will need to fit in both sessions' topics. All students who were supposed to present last week, will then present on May 16th. Thus, this is the list of presentations for next week: -          Game theories: Prisoner’s dilemma and tragedy of the commons (Timo V.) -          Design of common- pool resource institutions (Elinor Ostrom) (Feline) -          The major groups in the SDG negotiations  (Timo H.) -          The role of the High Level Political Forum (Anssi) See you all next week, all the best, Henrike",
