You are warmly invited to participate and deepen your knowledge.  Event type: Workshop / Meet&Greet (no credit points; limited seats; seats assignment on a first come first served policy)  Coordinator: Elena-Ramona Modroiu  Location: HFT-TA 340  Schedule:     Fr 24.05.2024 10:30-12:00     Fr 31.05.2024 10:30-12:00     Fr 07.06.2024 10:30-12:00     Fr 14.06.2024 10:30-12:00  Registration: email to elena-ramona.modroiu@tu-berlin.de  Content: Experiment with the latest open source mobile network technologies guided by our researchers. Students bring own notebook with Linux (preferable Ubuntu). Step by step instructions will be provided for each lab.  Lab-1: Software Defined Radio to implement a 5G antenna. Install srsRAN project and configure it to connect to a 5G core network installed and configured in the cloud. Connect a 5G capable mobile phone to the newly deployed private 5G network and test the connection to Internet.  Lab-2: 5G Core Network. Install an open source 5G core network on own notebook and configure it. High view on the main components.  Lab-3: Simulated UE and RAN (instead of over the air setup), for easier testing of more complex scenarios. Install an open source project simulating the  mobile phone (UE) and the 5G antenna (RAN) and configure it to connect to a 5G core network.  Lab-4: Adding over-the-top Voice Services to an existing 5G private network  Being a Meet&Greet event, you have the opportunity to ask our researchers about their current work, while also trying by yourself the main open source technologies for mobile networks, solving step by step the tasks we proposed in each lab.  To register please send an email to elena-ramona.modroiu@tu-berlin.de with the subject \"Registration for Workshop Series: Open Source Mobile Network Technologies\".  Looking forward to meeting you!",
