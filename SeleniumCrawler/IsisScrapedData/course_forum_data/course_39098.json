For those of you who could not attend the introduction today, we have uploaded a recording with more information on how to register. Unfortunately, the recording is somewhat broken and you cannot see the shared presentation. However, we have uploaded the presentation to ISIS.  After the registration, we will announce who got a spot in the seminar, and then you can give your topic preferences.  Best wishes, Philipp",
