Mr Kemper will give us an insight into his experiences with production scheduling at one of the world's leading car manufacturers, Volkswagen. As the current head of production master production scheduling, Dr. Kemper has been instrumental in shaping the efficiency and effectiveness of Volkswagen's production processes. His leadership in the innovative \"Digitaler Blick\" project earned his team a special prize at the German Award for Supply Chain Management in 2020, highlighting his profound understanding of contemporary industry challenges. After graduating at the Technical University Braunschweig (industrial engineering) and Technical University Dortmund (mechanical engineering), he was a lecturer at the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences for supply-chain-management and logistics management. Mr Kemper has been working at Volkswagen since 2016, initially as Head of Strategy, Communication and the Logistics Campus, making him one of the youngest heads ever at Volkswagen. His commitment to advancing the field extends beyond his professional role, as he actively contributes to the research council of the BVL, an almost 10.000 members strong network promoting ideas in supply chain management and logistics. Attendance for this unique opportunity is highly recommended and we are looking forward to seeing you all there! If you would like to join us please register here. All the best, your POM-Team",

There are two options you may want to consider. Firstly, you can park your car at the S-Bahn Station Erkner. Next to the station is a limited number of parking spaces available. These spaces are free of charge, however, please note that they are frequently used by commuters traveling to Berlin, so availability is not guaranteed. If you manage to find a parking spot, you can then catch the TES-Shuttle at 2:05 pm or any earlier shuttle. Alternatively, your second option is to drive directly to the Gigafactory. There are approximately 100 parking spots reserved for visitors, located in front of the Visitor Centre. As far as I am aware, these spots are currently free of charge.

The excursion will take place together with our research seminar. To ensure that everyone has an equal chance to register, registration for the limited number of places will start today at 2pm via the link provided here in the ISIS course. If you successfully register for the excursion, we ask you to hand over a deposit of 5 euros to professor Volling next Tuesday(05/07) after the lecture. Please bring exactly 5 euros, as we will not be able to give change. The money will of course be returned to you when you arrive for the excursion. IMPORTANT! By signing up for the excursion, you consent to register as a guest in the Tesla portal with your full name, e-mail, and photo. Recommended arrival: Depart from Zoologischer Garten at 1:08 pm on the RE 1, arriving in Erkner at 1:46 pm. Then, catch the TES-Shuttle at 2:05 pm, which will get you to the factory by 2:16 pm. From the arrival point, proceed to the lobby, which should take approximately 10 minutes at a releaxed pace. We look forward to seeing you there and wish you a successful week! All the best, Nico",
