I assume the 3 papers you refer to in the announcement post are Suter et. al., Jainmairet et.al, and Weber et. al. 2. What scope should the essay have? Should it be a simple summary of the paper on 2-3 pages, should it provide more background on the concepts in the paper, or should it compare the paper to other literature? 3. What scope should the presentation have? You have allocated the Thursdays for the presentation does that mean we should aim to fill the 1.5 hours (including questions) or should it be a more typical 30 minute presentation? Many thanks  Max",
