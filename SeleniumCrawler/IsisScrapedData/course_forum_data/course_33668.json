This project course is offered  for students interested in learning about computer vision and how motion helps us to perceive our environment. The course has a theory part covering fundamentals of Computer Vision together with paper discussion sessions to get you familiar with latest research in computer vision and robotics. In practical sessions the stage is yours and you will work on a research project within small groups. Within those research projects students are encouraged to further develop existing computer vision algorithms and bring them into the real world. Key questions are, how can we use motion to better get information from our surrounding (e.g. depth information, object motion)? Instead of seeing motion as an additional challenge for vision algorithms, we aim at actively exploiting advantages that we can gain through motion and help us to make sense of our surrounding. We will work with LEGO Mindstorms (the robot inventor) equipped with a RasberryPi and camera, which provides an easy setup for the integration of video analysis and camera control algorithms. Good python programming skills are required!
