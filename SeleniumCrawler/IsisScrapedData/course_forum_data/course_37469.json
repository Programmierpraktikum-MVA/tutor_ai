I'm open to counter-suggestions or if anyone wants to change something. I basically structured the requirements as a dialogue. I thought we can have a little discussion about who described diffusion better or who produced more important research results something like this.  Start of conversation  - Pleasantries are exchanged  - Both notice that their results seem quite similar   Fick explains how his results are to be understood and how he arrived at them  - Ficks interpretation  - Ficks Derivation   Einstein explains how his results are to be understood and how he arrived at them  - Einstein's interpretation  - Einstein's Derivation   Fick uses use cases to argue that his results are more important because of their practical relevance or whatever.  - Ficks use cases   Einstein uses use cases to argue that his results are more important  - Einstein's Use Cases  Both agree that both are important findings and that the diffusion is well described (happy end)",
