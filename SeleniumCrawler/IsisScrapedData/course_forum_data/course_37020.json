TU Berlin E-Mail would be my preferred method. If you have written to me since Friday afternoon, please send the email again. The last email I received at my DAI address was on Friday at 15:00. This may also affect the start of the seminar next week; I don't know if the room in the TEL building will be available until that day. I will update you as soon as I know more.
