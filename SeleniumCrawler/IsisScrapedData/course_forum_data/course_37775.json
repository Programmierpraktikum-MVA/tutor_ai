In particular, he will talk about and demonstrate the popular profilers VTune (Win/Linux) and Instruments (Mac). Everyone will also get the opportunity to play around a little with these tools so, in preparation, let me advise everyone to install one of these tools before Monday and maybe fiddle around with them a little if you're so inclined. If you're on Linux and have issues installing VTune, you can try a FOSS tool called perf which also has FOSS gui called hotspot; note: while these tools are not explicitly covered in the lecture, many profiler concepts will also apply to them. The lecture starts on Monday, July 8th at 12h sharp in MAR0.002. Looking forward to seeing y'all on Monday -Mathias Weller",

Please fill out this questionnaire until Monday 23:59 if you would like to participate in the code review (please fill out only once per team). Teams that fill out the questionnaire will receive code from the 2nd milestone of another participating team (if you don't participate, your code will not be sent to anyone) Until 12th July you then do a code review of the code given to you: Write a 1+ page code review (this will later be sent to the team that wrote the code) (submit a single PDF, otherwise no strict format/layout/structure requirements) Your code review has no impact on the other teams grade Be kind in your code review. The focus should be on giving useful feedback for the other team Keep in mind the information conveyed in the code review lecture If you're referring to specific lines of code include them (inline code block), rather than referencing by line numbers+file. If you can find bugs, bottlenecks that can be easily fixed, or easy speedups that can be achieved, do point them out  Best, Aleksander",

Ab sofort kannst du dich wieder als Mentor*in anmelden und wir freuen uns, wenn du dieses Jahr (wieder) dabei bist. Mentoring ist mehr als nur ein Modul, denn als Mentor*in profitierst du mindestens genauso davon wie hinterher die Erstis von dir. Auch in diesem Jahr haben wir Events für Mentor*innen geplant mit vielen Gelegenheiten, die Uni aus einer anderen Perspektive, mit neuen Möglichkeiten kennen zu lernen. Außerdem bieten wir dir zusätzlich: 3 LP Vorbereitungsschulungen, Feedbacktreffen und individuelle Begleitung Lerninhalte wie z.B. Gruppenleitung, Kommunikation, Motivation, Awareness u.v.m. Mentor*innenevents mit hohem Spaßfaktor Achso, du weißt noch gar nicht was deine Aufgabe als Mentor*in ist? Du begleitest im Team eine Gruppe von Erstis bei ihrem Start ins Studium. Wie genau das gedacht ist kannst du auf unserer Website erfahren oder auch in einem unserer kommenden Q&A Treffen. Komm vorbei und stelle deine Fragen.

                                    "Content": "Dear Participants, First, as indicated earlier, we would really like to give everyone the opportunity (and a few tools) to do a (proper) code review, as this is something considered essential in the industry. I am preparing a short \"lecture\" for Monday introducing and motivating code reviews, as well as giving some pointers on how to conduct one. Although I'm not an expert either, I hope to still spark a discussion and maybe give enough pointers so that everyone can at least start to conduct a code review and/or prepare their own code for such a review. Regarding the actual review, we are considering giving a few \"bonus\"-portfolio-points for conducting one. Around the time of the second milestone, we will probably ask every team whether they want to participate in the reviewing and, if so, try to organize \"review circles\" partitioned by employed programming language. Second, as I do consider myself somewhat of a C++-enthusiast, I feel that I can maybe teach the teams that are coding in C++ some indications that may help them keep their code clean and efficient, as well as enable a few participants to give a more effective code review, should they decide to participate in the process. Both \"lectures\" will be given back-to-back (maybe with a break) on the coming Monday, June 3 in MAR0.002 starting 12h15. Neither of them is mandatory, everyone can decide for themselves whether they want to come. Slides will be uploaded to ISIS. In particular, if you have no previous knowledge of C++ the second lecture will probably not provide alot to take home. The first lecture will be more general and not language-dependant. Looking forward to seeing y'all on Monday -Mathias Weller",

Such information has to be retrieved in a glance, without having to read through alot of text. Therefore, your handout... needs to be well-structured, following the structure of your presentation; I recommend having different subsections about: (i) exact/parameterized algorithms (ii) data-reduction (iii) upper-/lower-bounds (iv) heuristics/approximation (which actually are lower bounds... you'll figure something out) should be concise without lyrical boiler-plate does not need an introduction to/motivation of the clique problem (you can define it if you want) does not need a conclusion/outlook (again, not a paper) remember that your handout should not replace, but support your talk. on the subject of structure, it can be helpful to use proper definition- and theorem- environments; they don't need to contain alot of text; remember to use bulletpoint lists when listing things, also in definitions/theorems it can also be helpful to guide the attendees attention by hightlighting some keywords (sparsely! don't overdo it) using bold font; this further reduces the time it takes to find a concept that I might want to look up again during the presentation the literature-review is not about what you plan to implement, but what people have been doing in the past to solve the problem, what strategies are there, which ones worked well on what kinds of inputs, etc. EDIT: actually, it's fine to include a final section about what you're planning to implement, sorry for the confusion. you can put pseudocode on your handout, but don't overdo it, communicate ideas rather than code. For example, it is way more useful to me to read \"compute a maximal independent set\" than to look at the pseudocode that does it if you have space, put a figure to illustrate complicated concepts; even better if the figure also occurs in your presentation, then I can visually match them put running times/kernel sizes in the handout, we want to see lots of O(...)s  I hope this helps everyone improve their handouts and maybe even their presentations and I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone found out on Monday.",

For example, you are free to play with margins, negative \\vspace, paralist's compactitem and compactenum, as well as font sizes. If you still have problems fitting everything you need on the handout in 2 pages (including references), try to cut down some unimportant references for the print version and make a seperate digital version that may exceed 2 pages.  In any case (and I forgot to tell you this, mea culpa): please send the handout (both versions if you made a seperate online version) to me in time (at least 2h before our session on Monday), so I can print/upload them.",

The slides will be made available afterwards. Please note that we currently have way more sign-ups in the course than there is capacy (12 teams x 3 people per team).

In the spirit of fairness, we'd also have to mandate English for the other group, but if you really cannot give a presentation in English and are not assigned to MAR0.009, then you can try to negotiate with Aleksander Figiel and Prof. Schmid. However, even if they do allow presentations in German, those would have to be the first presentations of the session, since we're planning on merging the groups after the first 3 presentations (so we'd have non-German-speakers in the room starting with the 4th presentation). This also implies that, if more then 3 groups ask to do their presentation in German, we'd have to deny all of them.",

When will be the first lecture/meeting? The kick-off meeting was helt on April 24. There will probably be a lecture to bring everyone who did not participate in Algorithm Engineering 1 up to speed, next Monday or the week after. The first meetings with presentations from participants will be on Monday, May 27.  When do we start researching/programming? As you now know that all teams will work on the same problem (MaxClique), you can start researching now. It's not a good idea to start coding without an idea of what algorithms exist, so I would not start programming right away. Do some research before and prepare the first milestone presenation.  When do we register? Everyone who participated in the topic selection should register in MOSES as soon as possible. Registration is open until mid May (if you missed that deadline, please contact us via email and we'll see what we can do).",

                                    "Content": "Hello Michelle, while we intended to do much less \"hand-holding\" in this project than in Algorithm Engineering 1, we decided to provide a short overview over the most important (general) techniques used to attack computationally hard problems (such as MaxClique). That's what the upcoming \"lecture\" will be about. We will upload (to ISIS) some pieces of information about what we expect in your milestone presentation and report, and how to give a convincing presentation, as well as templates for slides and reports.  Now, to answer your questions:  What are the contents of the milestone presentations in detail and what are the requirements? For Milestone 1 (\"literature research\"), you're supposed to review available literature about how other people have solved MaxClique before and what problems they encountered. Remember that we're interested in exact solutions, but heuristics and approximation algorithms may still be useful to provide upper bounds. Interesting results include, but are not limited to: parameterized algorithms other exact algorithms preprocessing and kernelization ILP-formulations upper-bound techniques lower-bound techniques For Milestone 2 (\"implementation\"), you're supposed to produce a working implementation of promising algorithms that you found in the first part (milestone 1), that is, implement an exact solver (which may use data-reduction as well as upper-bound heuristics). In the presentation, we would like to see some details and maybe some first tests on the instances that we'll provide. Try to find a way of judging whether certain tricks (found in the first part or thought-of yourself) are advantagous.  For Milestone 3 (\"algorithm engineering\"), you're supposed to go through \"The Algorithm Engineering Cycle\". If you're unsure of what that means, we'll give some pointers, but basically, you run your implementation, understand why its slow for some instances, analyze the problematic instances in order to come up with strategies to improve performance, and repeat.   When do we get the tools to upload our Code? Once Milestone 1 has been passed.  When will we get the examples? I suppose you're referring to the \"public instances\" that you can run your solver on to test its performance? We're currently working on generating those, but we'd like you to do the literature research for the first milestone without bias on the particular types of instances that will be provided.  What are the exercise sheets? I'm not sure what you mean, what exercise sheets?",
