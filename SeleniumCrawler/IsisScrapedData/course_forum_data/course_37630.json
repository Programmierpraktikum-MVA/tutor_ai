Attendance is not mandatory to take part in the course but it is recommended. If you have your own project ideas please let me know in advance by then.  After the Kick-Off, we will unlock a survey where you can enter your preferences and select a project from the available ones. Usually there are enough projects available for everyone to participate. Registration for the module will open some weeks later.  Best, Max ",
