Below are some instructions regarding the exam: the exam will be held in room MA 001. Please be there no later than 17:20; exam sheets will be handed out at 17:30; it is not necessary to bring blank sheets for the solution, they will be provided by us; the duration of the exam is 90 minutes, extra 10 minutes will be provided at the beginning to read the tasks and ask questions; the exam is open-book, i.e., you are allowed to consult any written material during the exam; the use of electronic devices is not allowed (not even calculators or tablets); remember to bring your student card. Regarding the type of questions you should expect in the exam: the exam will cover all the topics seen in the course; the tasks of the exam will mostly consist in exercises; however, small theoretical questions may be asked; computer exercises will not be part of the exam; in preparation for the exam, we recommend that you practice solving the exercises of the course, and review the topics covered in class. Ideally, you should be able to do the calculations fast enough so that you will have time for solving tasks that require more reasoning. Best, Davide",

All Simulink models that will be shared during the semester are to be considered as additional material that may be useful to bridge the gap between theory and applications. Feel free to download, edit, and \"play\" with them. If you find any problem with the Simulink models, you can either contact me before/after every exercise session or via email, or create a post in the Participant's forum. Also some of the exercises will deal with modeling and simulation of hybrid systems using Simulink; nevertheless, knowledge of Simulink will not be required for the exam.  Have fun!  Best, Davide",
