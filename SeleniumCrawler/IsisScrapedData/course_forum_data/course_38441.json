Please note, that this coursework is worth only 10% of the overall grade, in comparison to 30% for the prior courseworks 1, 2, and 3. You should be able to go to https://git.tu-berlin.de/ and see a new repository called cw4. I believe you have as well received an email from the GitLab server. The git repository has been created at: https://git.tu-berlin.de/compiling-techniques/2024/<GITLAB_USERNAME>/<GITLAB_USERNAME>-cw4 The repository contains a README with the tasks of the coursework and instructions on how to get started. The deadline for submission is the Monday the 29th of July 2024 at midnight. You submit by pushing your changes to the GitLab server before the deadline. Please test early that you have a working setup allowing you to push to the server (e.g., by creating yourself an SSH key). We will run the Labs again on Fridays at 12:15pm in room EN-362. You can also post questions on the ISIS forum. All the best with the coursework, Michel",

The coursework will be focused on optimization techniques to reduce the number of instructions while still computing the correct results. Here particularly, register allocation as discussed in the lecture will be one area to focus on.  I want to apologize for the confusion regarding the lecture last week. I have provided links to an interesting talk presenting an important advanced compiler optimization technique in the ISIS course (https://isis.tu-berlin.de/mod/url/view.php?id=1853576). While this talk will not be relevant for the coursework, it provides insights into modern compiler optimizations.  All the best, Michel",

I am very excited about this course, as I am fairly new at TU Berlin and this is the first course I will be teaching here. I am looking forward to seeing many of you in class, but I am also still figuring much stuff about teaching at TU Berlin out myself - so please be patient with me.  It has been pointed out to me that my original proposed times (Tuesdays at 3pm and Fridays at 1pm) are rather unusual for TU Berlin. Therefore, I have shifted the times to: Lectures on Tuesdays 14:15–15:45 in Room EN-352 and Labs on Fridays 12:15–13:45 EN-362.  As I am still new at TU Berlin, I have missed the chance to get a large central room allocated for this course. Therefore, we will do the following for the lectures on Tuesdays:  - As the room EN-352 has only room for at best 30 people,  - I will be streaming the lecturer live via Zoom(https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/j/61598109869?pwd=L3NvbmI2bnQyT3ZObi9BQmxGN3VZZz09)  - I will provide the recordings of the Zoom lectures every Tuesday evening here on this ISIS course. I can't guarantee an outstanding quality of the streaming/recordings, but I will give it my best.  The labs on Fridays will provide a space for you to work on the coursework and ask questions. These will be in room EN-362. You are not required to attend each lab, but you are encouraged to use this time slot to work on your coursework and to come and ask questions in the lab.  Finally, I have been asked about the relationship between this course and the course \"Compiler Design\" that was taught last semester. Both courses teach compiler construction, so there is naturally an overlap in the topics taught in the two courses. I believe that it can still be beneficial to attend this class in addition to the Compiler Design class, as we will put a larger emphasis on the later stages of the compiler design phase (code generation and optimization) in this course. This course also puts great emphasis on the practical application of the theory learned in the lecturers, as it is graded purely on the compiler that you are developing in the class - there will be no written exam at the end of this course.  I am in touch with the Prüfungsauschuss to clarify if this course can be recognized also when you have already attended the \"Compiler Design\" class. I will update you on this as soon as we have clarified this.  As I said at the beginning, I am looking forward to seeing many of you in class on Tuesday - either in person or virtually.  With best wishes Michel Steuwer",

It made it a lot easier for me:) Nonetheless I am stumbeling across the list implementation. The readme says: _malloc: Allocate in the heap the number of bytes given as argument, and return a pointer to it (assume you will always have enough space to allocate memory). So we should be able to allocate just one byte on the heap and return its pointer, right? In my understanding, the AllocOP() just allocs 4 bytes on the stack. I see two problems: 1. How do we access the heap and get the requested number of bytes(e.g. 3) allocated since we only have AllocOP() 2. We could use AllocOP multiple times, but then there is no guarantee that these are located after one another for accessing them with incrementing offsets, right? Hopefully, Vinzenz",

Since I pass every other test except the ones for runtime errors, I don't think this is a consequential error from another wrongly implemented pattern.

After yet another extensive round of testing, I can't recall what explicit changes were missing in my previous approach, but one thing was the obvious LW-instruction after calculating the address. Knowing the meaning of the 0x1! error helped a lot in the end as well when I started getting it. The rough approach when implementing this pattern within this accursed framework, based on the very helpful snippet in an earlier answer, would therefore look like this:  - SLL (shifting the same amount as in GetAddress) and adding 4 (since index 0 doesn't contain a char) to 'indexString.index' - Addr = new index + indexString.value - Load char at index via LW & Addr - ptr1 = Allocating 8 bytes and using SW at imm0 = 1 and imm4 = char - ptr2 = Allocating 4 bytes and using SW for imm0 = ptr1  Maybe this can help others as well. Thanks again for all the help!",

The input you are given is flat choco SSA. The output you produce may only contain riscv SSA. All input operations must be replaced. Error 1 translates to (human-readable): \"You gave the riscv_ssa.beq (bne) operation an operand of type choco.ir.named_type<\"int (/ bool)\">. In riscv ssa, the operand must be riscv ssa. For beq, the operand must be of type riscv_ssa.reg\" Error 2 has the same cause. The choco.ir.load operation is flat choco, the operand given is a riscv ssa value (from riscv_ssa.alloc). To debug this further, it would be relevant to know where the error occurs. Is the given SSA the final output of your choco-opt (i.e. the output of choco-opt -p riscv file.choc), and if so, what is the input? My guess would be that at least one of your patterns has not been fully implemented yet, but doesn't raise an exception either. Thus, flat choco SSA is left in the output. Alternatively, it could be that one of your patterns doesn't erase nor replace the matched op (only inserts ops before it), leading to the same result.",

Since I dont branch here I will get True at the end.  Now lets say we have the programm print(False and True): This time I need to branch, since the first value is false and we dont need to check the rhs anymore.
