If 400GW was installed during 2023, (400 * 1.2) GW will be installed in 2024, and so on. Question 4-b) You are expected to compare the cost of hydrogen derived in question a) to the cost of using natural gas, considering associated emissions. MWh(H2) and MWh(th) can directly be compared here Let us know if there are any further questions, enjoy the rest of your week ! Clara",
