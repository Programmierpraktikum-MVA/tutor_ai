As always you will be able to discuss Sheet 1 up to the current Sheet, Sheet 9 with me. Furthermore, as always we can also discuss theory and also the mock exam, however on the second one, this time I might not be able to answer all questions properly. This only will be the case next week. Similarly, as I have not received any specific topic requests for this week, I won't be especially prepared to explain lecture material in detail, just as usual from my regular knowledge. Therefore I want to emphasize again to please name specifics about topics until next Wednesday evening, in case you want to discuss lecture material on them in detail next week.

Apart from that, I will as always answer questions and help out with your solutions on this sheet. Furthermore, as has been the case lately, due to low number of questions on the current sheets, I expect again to be able to answer questions on all sheets up to and including Sheet 7.
