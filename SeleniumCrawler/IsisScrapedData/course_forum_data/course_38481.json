I'm not sure if your question is still relevant to you, but the answer is that it depends. We defined this seminar to be only eligible with Machine Learning I or II and Deep Learning I or II to ensure students have some understanding of machine learning. However, since I feel that students taking CA have quite diverse backgrounds and knowledge, you can take the seminar if you are fine with the somewhat enhanced difficulty of many of the discussed papers.  Don't hesitate to contact me if you have further questions. Next time, I'll answer way faster!  Best, Florian",
