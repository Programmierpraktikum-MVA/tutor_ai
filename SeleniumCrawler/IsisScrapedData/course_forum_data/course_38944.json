Registration for exams is mandatory, so everyone must register for the module exam. If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the registration process, please email Kirill Andreev at kirill.andreev@tu-berlin.de. He will be able to assist you and register you if necessary. Additionally, the Course Assessment Components have been updated to include assessments for both 6 credits and 3 credits. Notice Regarding Credits and Homework Assignments Please refer to the recently updated \"Course Description & Assessment Components\" document for details on the assessment components for 6 and 3 credits, including the inclusion of homework assignments in the course grading. Due to the delay and update regarding the inclusion of homework assignments as part of your grade, you are permitted to revisit and upload your previous homework assignments from the past weeks. Please ensure that you upload a minimum of six homework assignments to be eligible for grading in this category. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.",

Reading Assignment: \"The Aesthetics of Failure: Post-Digital Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music\" By Kim Cascone   ·      Focus on how Cascone discusses post-digital aesthetics, particularly the roles of failure, glitches, and imperfections in expanding musical boundaries.   ·      Consider how post-digital aesthetics can expand the boundaries of music and create distinct vocabularies and sonic explorations.     ·      Think about how these ideas, articulated by Cascone in 2000 and by Russolo in 1913, remain relevant today, especially in the context of contemporary technology and AI tools we have discussed.   Assignment for Next Session: Continue to reflect on our discussions from last week about text-to-audio models. Experiment with text-to-audio prompts, paying close attention to your inputs, expectations, outputs, and how you perceive them.   As part of your assignment, I would like you to explore the text-to-audio modality through the perspectives highlighted in Kim Cascone’s paper “The Aesthetics of Failure: Post-Digital Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music.” Focus on how failure, glitches, and imperfections can be creatively embraced and how these elements expand musical boundaries. Experiment with different text-to-audio prompts and reflect on how the outputs align with post-digital aesthetics. Please send me any interesting results or outputs that you find relevant for discussion in our next session. Feel free to email your findings to guilherme.coelho@thenewcentre.org.   Consider these questions: ·      How can AI-driven music models incorporate post-digital aesthetics? Consider the potential for these models to generate music that embraces imperfection and recombination. ·      Compare the post-digital tendencies described by Cascone with the concepts we've discussed. How do your expectations and preconceived notions about music and your prompts influence your perception of AI-generated outputs? ·      Reflect on the relevance of Cascone’s and Russolo’s ideas today. How can these concepts be applied to modern text-to-audio tools?   Be ready to discuss your reflections and insights from these readings and activities. In the next class, we will discussthese ideas, examining the concepts of deconstruction, territorialization, and deterritorialization, and their implications for creativity and AI. This will build on the foundational concepts we have covered so far, providing a richer understanding of how these theories intersect with contemporary music practices and AI technologies.  ",

Reflect on the ways these frameworks are part of your daily interactions and perceptions.  While it is not mandatory to answer all of the questions or read the additional paper regarding schemas, I encourage you to explore these materials to the extent that your curiosity and schedule allow. Engaging with these resources will enrich our discussions and your critical thinking skills. Reading Assignment: Please read Neil Leach's paper, \"In the Mirror of AI: What is Creativity?\". Pay particular attention to the discussions on AI creativity, human creativity, and the implications of AI on our understanding of creativity. 1. Regarding Leach's Paper: ·      How does Leach's discussion on AI challenge traditional notions of creativity? ·      Do you agree with the assertion that AI can offer new insights into the nature of human creativity? Why or why not? 2. Regarding Structuralism: ·      How do structuralist theories help us understand the way we perceive and create music? ·      Can you think of a specific example (from music, literature, or another cultural domain) where a meta-narrative shapes our understanding and interpretation?  3. Regarding Meta-Narratives: ·      Identify a meta-narrative in music or popular culture. Describe how this meta-narrative influences the way we understand and appreciate the music or cultural artifact. ·      How might challenging this meta-narrative change our perception or experience?  4. Regarding Schemes: ·      Reflect on your own musical schemes. How do they shape your expectations and judgments about music? ·      Describe an instance where a piece of music either fit perfectly within your existing schemas or challenge them significantly.  Personal tasks: Write a short reflection (1-2 pages) on how the concepts of structuralism, meta-narratives, and schemas influence your understanding of music and creativity. How do these theories help you make sense of your own creative processes and the music you listen to? In what ways do you see these being applied to the development and functioning of AI models, particularly in the realm of creative AI (such as AI-generated music, art, and literature)? Additional material: Additionally, I have attached a document (2. Basic Concepts of Schema Theory by Jeff Pankin) regarding the basic concepts of schemas that you can read to further enhance your intellectual depth on these matters. This document will provide a comprehensive understanding of schema theory and its relevance to our discussions. Be prepared to discuss your reflections and insights from these readings and activities in our next session. We will get into post-structuralism and its implications for creativity and AI, building on the foundational concepts we have covered so far.",

In preparation for our next session, please take a moment to reflect on these discussions and reply to the following questions. Questions to reply for next week:  1. How would you define creativity? In your own words, craft a dictionary-like definition of creativity. Aim for a broad perspective that could apply across different domains. 2. Write a second definition of creativity specifically tailored to the context of music. 3. Identify a song that you believe exemplifies each of the following categories: combinatory, exploratory and particularly transformational creativity. Explain why you chose the song for the transformational creativity category. Specifically explain why you chose the song for the transformational creativity category. Consider how the song has altered musical norms, led to entirely new frameworks or fundamentally changed a paradigm. We will explore your responses to these questions in our next session. Please read 'In the Mirror of AI: What is Creativity?' by Neil Leach. We will explore these perspectives in our next session.",
