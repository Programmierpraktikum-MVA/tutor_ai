On Monday, June 17, the group/topic selection will be unlocked here on ISIS until Wednesday, June 19 at 11:59 pm. In groups of three or four, choose one of the two quiz topics (MPP or ALB). Based on this decision, you will compose your paper. Also on Monday, June 17, there will be an online session by Professor Volling on the introduction to scientific work. One week later on June 24, we will meet again in room H6126 to discuss your idea for model expansion, the potential title of your paper, and your initial reference papers. I highly recommend to prepare yourselves and your project idea as well as possible (slides or similar) so that you can receive constructive feedback. You can also find all the information in the schedule and the first slides for introduction. Until then, best of luck with the quiz, and greetings, Nico",

There are two options you may want to consider. Firstly, you can park your car at the S-Bahn Station Erkner. Next to the station is a limited number of parking spaces available. These spaces are free of charge, however, please note that they are frequently used by commuters traveling to Berlin, so availability is not guaranteed. If you manage to find a parking spot, you can then catch the TES-Shuttle at 2:05 pm or any earlier shuttle. Alternatively, your second option is to drive directly to the Gigafactory. There are approximately 100 parking spots reserved for visitors, located in front of the Visitor Centre. As far as I am aware, these spots are currently free of charge.

The notebooks and solutions uploaded by us should contain everything you need for the self-study.  However, it is important that you do not miss the deadlines for registration, quizzes and group finding.  Best regards, Nico",

Since I'll be following the lectures online and if for some reason I can't really cope up with the course since I won't be able to do the lectures in person at least until June, in that case, will I be able to unenroll/de-register from the course? I mean if I find it hard to self study, can I deregister in the middle? Thank you sir.",
