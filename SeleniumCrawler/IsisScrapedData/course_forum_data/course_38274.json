This will act instead of a waiting list this year, and those of you who have already agreed on swapping will be able to do it. The others who are still looking for a place or will deregister can post it under the newly created Swapping Forum.   Once when you agree with somebody, you will need to send me an email with the subject [UE2024-SWAP], and in the email, tell me your name and the name of the person you are swapping with (including the second person in cc would be perfect if you can).  All correctly communicated swaps will be allowed, and you don't need to wait for confirmation from me, but you can register for MOSES.  All deadlines remain the same. Registrations and swapping will only be possible in the deadlines that have been stated from the beginning.  Hint: I will publish the placement list of MMI a day earlier (on the 25th) so that those deciding between those two courses can have a day overlapping. So, I assume the last day of the registration in the forum could be the most active.  Best regards,  Tanja ",
