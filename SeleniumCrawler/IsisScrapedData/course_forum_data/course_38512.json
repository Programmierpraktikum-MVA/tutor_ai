                                    "Content": "Hello dear course participants,  I would like to provide you with a template with which you can distribute sound sources in the room (mono sources) and add them to your Ambisonic Recordings (please make sure that your files fulfil the ACN convention an SN3D normalization, the order doesn't matter).  The template is stored under this cloud Link. To be able to use the template, you must first install the free DAW Reaper (Link to the software) and also the IEM Plugin Suite (Link to the software). In the project you can see three colour-coded tracks: Binaural: This is where your encoded audio streams are sent so that you can listen to the content via headphone Loudspeaker: This is the transmitter track that decodes the signal and distributes it to the speakers (you don't have to change anything here) Ambisonics Bus:  Here you can store your AmbiX (Ambisonics file). The positioned/added sound sources also arrive on this bus. Source Quellen: You can store mono/stereo sources here, which can then be distributed anywhere in the sphere. To do this, click on the green FX button and position them freely in the IEM stereo encoder. Sources 1-4 are \"fixed\" sources (test the signals that are in there and sound in the right place), and source 5 is not fixed. If you have any questions, you can contact us at any time and we will have the opportunity to make changes again on Friday.  Best regards  Moritz Schuck",

Unfortunately, it turned out that not everyone will be able to attend the BOL session (e.g., all of Group 1). As we are now planning to hold our final session at the Berlin Open Lab (July 19) using the technology there, we would like to provide you with another date where you can prepare your audio recordings. if you are interested in. Ideally next week on the July 12 after Pamela Jordan's visit and her guest lecture. However, we would like to mention that we are currently conducting a small study in the BOL on the perception of traffic noise and that it would be great if some of you could show up this Friday (12.00) to take part in the experiment (and also receive a small compensation). We could then also use the time to talk about your project work, if desired. Best regards, André Fiebig, Moritz Schuck",

It would be also nice, if your can bring the acoustic and/or subjective date that you've collected so far to be able to analyse and discuss the results together. Furthermore you are welcome to familiarise yourself with pandas (a data management tool) using this tutorial: (https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/pandas_dataframe_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb).
