I think this captures why \"[...] from A contained [...]\" was used in the text, because we have two existential quantors. This corresponds to your EVERY version (unless I'm confusing things again, which might very well be possible).  Further, if we transform the second existential quantor into a universal one (so this is equivalent to the formalized definition above), we get: . Back to natural language: \"There is a trivial pair such that not all (or: not EVERY non-trivial pair) non-trivial pairs may reach it\". This explains where the every/any/a confusion comes from, I think.  Additionally, if ANY was the intended meaning here, I'd wonder: If there is a trivial pair in a simulation which is not reachable from any non-trivial pair, how did it end up in the simulation in the first place? (But honestly, I might be mixing up passive form or negation here again, I'm not sure...)  I hope this makes sense. Best Nate",
