Please watch the last two videos from Prof. Petermann, about the optical transmission channel. The videos are already uploaded and available. On the 19.07 you are free (no lecture and no video). If you have not completed the evaluation yet, please kindly do so ASAP (it will close on 12.07, already extended). Here the link. Particularly useful are constructive, open comments that help me to improve. Thanks in advance! Besides the exam on 22.07, there will be another one at the end of August/early Sept., and I will try to offer one opportunity every month also during the WiSe 24/25 (on a best effort basis).  I hope you enjoyed the course! I had fun discussing many matters with you during the lectures. Please let me know if you need any clarification. And if not, I will see you at the exam!

There will be several possible dates. Two dates are already available on MOSES. There will be also another date in August (exact date TBD). In general, whenever possible, I try to offer new exam dates also during the semester. To register for a specific exam date, please do that on MOSES and also send an email to me (burla@tu-berlin.de), Mr S. Aboulela (aboulela@campus.tu-berlin.de) and Ms G. Pergl (g.pergl@tu-berlin.de), indicating your Matrikel Nr. and any special wishes or constraints on the time of the exam (if any). The exam consists in an oral discussion of 45 min covering several topics of the course. After the registration deadline is over, we will prepare an exam schedule which we will share shortly before the exam date with all the people who registered as indicated above, so that each person knows their time slot.
