We have provided two research papers for each topic. Please use that as the first reading material. Also, do more literature research concerning your ideas and prepare to answer questions concerning your approach and problem in the context of existing relevant approaches and how your approach differs. 2. Define your approach's scope, environment, and relevant measurements, and outline the setting for your architecture. Use this to your advantage, but don't abuse it.  Overall, you are all great on track with this assignment. There are already lots of great ideas and considerations. Should you have any further questions. Feel free to send us an email.

The question is aimed at two common issues: Firstly, training and using AI models, especially larger ones such as LLMs, have a significant impact on your application's energy consumption and carbon emissions. Hence, the question is, how can you account for that, given the value it's adding to the system? Secondly, some approaches (esp. given small training data) have implicit biases; depending on how you use the tools and where you use them, such a bias might have ethical implications, e.g., turning off components or scaling some down may prohibit some user groups from accessing your services. As with all the refactoring goals, we expect you to discuss and argue for the benefits and trade-offs of using this technology. Moreover, the question here is whether you can use technical means to make the actions and costs (in terms of sustainability) of using these approaches accountable so that issues can be spotted later on. Hope that helps, best, Sebastian",

I was going through the reading materials, however, I could not understand the relation between the given topic and the second reading material. As it is a long article, I would like to ask about the conceptual relevance before deciding whether to read it all or focus/research other papers from that domain.  Sincerely, Deniz Mert Tecimer",

The paper, thus, functions as a first idea of how you could \"infuse AI\" beyond the application layer and thus should function as a good starting point. So, you should read this paper with the objective of identifying \"infused AI\" in this domain and getting ideas and snowballing material to find other approaches. In general, I would strongly recommend that you find other also directions in the literature that could apply to microservices or service architectures, regardless of how long the articles are, as foundational materials for the assignments.

So, students who applied last year and got rejected have a higher priority when getting a slot. Make sure to mention this as part of the application process. More announcements will follow on the 8th. Best, Sebastian and the CNAE team",
