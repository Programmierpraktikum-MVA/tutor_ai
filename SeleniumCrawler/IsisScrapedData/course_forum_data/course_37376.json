The steel factory is partly run by our former PhD Anne-Marie Großmann, who is one of the 100 most influential women in the German economy (Link) and actively transitioning her company to green steel production (Link). She is a very prominent figure in the green steel transition and I am thus very proud that we are able to visit the company's factory. Our general plan is to depart Berlin early in the morning via bus or train and be back in Berlin in the early evening, so you can enjoy your Friday evening as well.  Bear in mind that the Chair of Innovation Economics will organize the transportation and cover the travel costs. As seats are very limited (only 20 people incl. me can visit the factory), it is very important that you really attend if you signed up. If you’re interested, please write an email to Julia Gräfe (julia.graefe@tu-berlin.de). Best regards, Sokol Tominaj",

We still have a lecture one week prior: L13: Demand-Side Instruments: Public Procurement I need to ask now because I will be taking exams from the beginning of July. Will L13 still be included in the exam, even though we only have one week?! --or perhaps asked more politely: Will any content be omitted from the exam? [since even two weeks before the exam is tight] I apologize in advance for asking.  Best regards, Toshina",
