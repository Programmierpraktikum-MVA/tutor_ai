They created a web app combined with a camera that takes pictures pf products and stores them in a database. The camera and database part are not so useful, but maybe you can use the web app (or just create your own). For the voice assistant Luna, you can find the source code on my private github page: https://github.com/evardhen/Voice-Assistant Although I dont know if you actually need this, depending on what you are planning to implement. If any of you has not been added to the gitlab project, contact me via email or today in person.  Regards Henri",
