Er wird von 14:00 bis 15:30 Uhr eine Gastvorlesung im Raum MAR 0.003 (offiziell 24 Sitzplätze aber da lässt sich garantiert was machen) mit dem Titel „Lean Satellite: Delivering Satellite Values with Low Cost and Short Time“ im Rahmen meiner Veranstaltung „In Space Manufacturing“ halten. )   Aufgrund eines formalen Fehlers im MTS wurde meine Lehrveranstaltung keinem Studiengang zugeordnet, was zu einer geringen Teilnehmerzahl geführt hat. Ich würde mich daher sehr freuen, wenn ihr eure Studierenden ermutigen könntet, an der Vorlesung am Mittwoch teilzunehmen, damit Professor Cho nicht vor leeren Rängen steht. Ich freue mich auf eine kurze Rückmeldung.   Liebe Grüße Khalil",

Many things are changing on the SSDW: it is now a cooperation between two human spaceflight professorships, the Technical University of Munich (Prof. Detrell) and the University of Stuttgart (Prof. Olthoff). As in previous years, the SSDW addresses master and PhD students as well as young professionals with less than three years of work experience. The one-week challenge constitutes the unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in an international and interdisciplinary environment in order to design a concept for a future space station under guidance from experts from industry and academia. Further information about the workshop can be found on our website: www.SpaceStationDesignWorkshop.com We would kindly ask you to forward the information below. Furthermore, we attached a poster, which, if wanted, can be printed and hanged at feasible boards / locations. We are also going to publish information regarding the workshop in social media (Twitter @SpaceStationDW and Instagram @spacestationdw) Your help is highly appreciated, thank you in advance.
