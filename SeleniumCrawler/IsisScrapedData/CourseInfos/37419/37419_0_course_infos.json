    "Dear Students,",
    "Congratulations. You have secured a spot in the \"D.I.Y. - Paradigm Shift” Design Studio. We are looking forward to meeting all of you on our first studio day this Thursday at 10:00 in Studio A816. We have planned a day of short introductions about the studio\n topic as well as watching several videos. On Friday at 10:00, we will already have our first PiV session with Marta Fernandez Guardado.",
    "A couple of points to note for the beginning. Since numerous students didn’t receive a place in the studio, if by any chance you don’t want to participate in the D.I.Y. studio, or maybe you've changed your mind or have secured a place in another studio, please\n do let us know so that I can invite other students.",
    "The majority of our communication will take place on ISIS.",
    "Additionally, by the end of the month, we kindly ask you to register for the course on MOSES to avoid complications later in the semester.",

    "See you all on Thursday, and keep an eye out for announcements on ISIS.",
