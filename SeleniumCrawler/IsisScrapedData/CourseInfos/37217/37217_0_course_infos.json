    "During this course, participants work on a scientific project of limited scope under the supervision of an experienced researcher. Project topics vary every semester, but are always related to the current research projects of the Neural Information Processing Group. In the past, topics were selected from research fields including the modeling of neural systems, machine learning, artificial neural network and their application, and from the analysis of neural data. During the course, students will read original publications, learn how to prepare and present a brief project proposal, learn how to scientifically address a complex problem, learn how to discuss and defend their findings during a scientific poster session, and a how to compile their results in form of a typical conference paper."
