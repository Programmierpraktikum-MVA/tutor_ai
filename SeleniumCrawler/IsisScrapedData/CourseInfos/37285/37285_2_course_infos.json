    "For the proposal we expect around 3-5 pages that describe:",
    "- the motivation",
    "- why is the study important what is its impact (on practice, society, education,\nand/or science)",
    "- a short discussion of points of departure - short summary of the engineering challenge and the\nmethods that have been applied so far (what are the basic modeling methods you plan to apply,\nfor which other purposes have they been applied successfully, etc. don't do a large scale\nliterature review here, just something you already read found interesting",
    "- the development of a research question of hypotheses based on the motivation and the points\nof departure (what is missing, what don't we know yet). It is very important that you have a research question / hypotheses that points towards a contribution in the field of systems engineering. Systems engineering is the discipline of support creative engineering work, so we are interested in evaluating method / models / approaches /  of how to support engineering work. Evaluation can be done using interesting and specific cases, but we cannot supervise and evaluate project that simply want to model to advise of provide insights around a specific product or project.",
    "- a description of the research you plan to do - collect data, analyse data, model with some\nmethod, validate the model, etc. Please focus during your description on the details of the research work you plan to do (collect data, analyse data, model a system and evaluate the model, etc.) ... do not simply lump the most important tasks into one large task that you do not describe well. Steps such as 55 hours on modeling or 60 hours on developing software are not helpful to evaluate the scope. Be sensitive which parts are important for the success of your project and reflect in detail about this tasks",
    "- an assessment what you plan to do for how long (ca. 150-180 hours of work); please\nalso plan for the time you need to write the final report (I usually suggest about ½ - 1/3 of the\ntime for writing) and for the time you need to write this proposal; a schedule when you plan to do things during the semester is not so important - here it is really important that you scope the project within the 150-180 hours you have at hand",
    "Final report",
    "Allocate at least ⅓ of the time for writing (50 - 60 hours). Before starting to write plan a discussion meeting with stakeholders and experts. Then follow our generic",
    "scientific report structure",
    "- make sure that you clearly distinguish between point of departure (what was known before), your unbiased research results, and your discussion (you analysis of the results)",
