    "Master students of civil engineering can choose any of the three modeling modules as compulsory electives for the systems engineering focus. Civil Systems Engineering students need to choose the Projekt Systemtechnik as compulsory and can choose any of the three others as compulsory electives. You can sign up for modules as to any other module. In general, the modules are open for any students that are interested, of course, the topics need to fit in the research of the civil systems engineering department.",
