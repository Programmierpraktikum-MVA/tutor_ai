    "In this seminar report, you should address the following aspects:",
    "What is the scientific method, and what are the consequences for experiments and scientific papers in the area of anomaly detection?",
    "How is, in your view, the quality of published research in the area of anomaly detection?",
    "Did the quality of or the approach to anomaly detection approaches change over time?",
    "The report must follow general good practices of scientific work. For creating the overview it is expected that you pick three anomaly detection papers from the following decade: 19",
