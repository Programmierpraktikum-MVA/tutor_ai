    "From ecological catastrophes to health \ncrises to violent conflict, the world certainly faces many grand \nchallenges for which traditional developmental strategies have only \nyielded limited solutions. Many have begun recognizing the need for \ninnovative entrepreneurial solutions to tackle such challenges, and \nbuzz-terms such as “social entrepreneurship” and “sustainable \ninnovation” have become quite common. However, entrepreneurship and \ninnovation can also be blamed for much of the exacerbation of global \nsustainability crises. This course takes participants into an \nexplorative journey to reflect on some of the “tough, big, questions” on\n the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation, digitalization and \ngrand societal and environmental challenges, particularly in \nalready-challenged global contexts outside of stable, wealthy economies.\n This would include:",
    "-\n How can (innovative) entrepreneurship be a solution to some of the \nworld’s most daunting challenges amidst institutional fragility and \nresource scarcity?",
    "- What are some of the negative impacts of technology and entrepreneurship on society and ecology?",
    "- How can entrepreneurs and innovators find a balance between economic, ecologic, social and psychological priorities?",
    "- Is sustainability (in innovation and entrepreneurship) even possible? How and why?",
    "-\n How does context (e.g. political situation, cultural values, historical\n trauma) impact and determine the outcomes of and expectations from \nentrepreneurship and innovation?",
    "The\n course will draw on multidisciplinary theoretical streams and \ndisciplines (e.g. from psychology, biology, sociology, philosophy, \neconomics and environmental sciences) and will feature numerous case \nstudies from all over the world, aiming to build bridges between \nmicro-level factors and macro-level concepts and reflect on the grey \nareas between common “black and white” notions (e.g. sustainable vs. \nunsustainable behavior, developing vs. \ndeveloped countries, good vs. bad, and nature vs. nurture).",
