    "The lectures explain methods and algorithms, their underlying philosophy, as well as mathematical foundations from a rather theoretical point of view. Participants are expected to rehearse topics after class in preparation for the exercises.",
    "The exercises take place in parallel. They rehearse methods and algorithms from a more practical point of view, introduce variations and extensions, and discuss implementation details of the homework assignments.",
    "Homework assignments are given during the exercises and must be solved within two weeks. These assignments cover theoretical questions as well as programming exercises and are solved by working in small",
