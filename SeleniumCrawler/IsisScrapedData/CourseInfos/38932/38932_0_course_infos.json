    "In this seminar we will consider iterative methods to solve linear systems  of  equations, in particular multigrid and deflation methods.  Both types of methods",
    "can  be seen as multilevel iterations, which are be used as  solvers or preconditioner for Krylov subspace  methods. The seminar is intended for advanced bachelor or",
    "master level students \nwith a solid background in numerical mathematics as well as advanced \nknowlegde of numerical linear algebra obtained, for example, in the \ncourse",
    "NLA (or  NLA I+II) .",
    "The  seminar  participants are  expected to study and present a research\n article, and to write a short summary of the main results of this \narticle. Participation in the seminar is limited.  Working in groups is \nan option.A list of seminar talks can be found below.",
    "The talks are to be held  from end May to end of June.",
    "There  will be talks  on Mondays ( and if needed on Tuesdays )  16-18",
