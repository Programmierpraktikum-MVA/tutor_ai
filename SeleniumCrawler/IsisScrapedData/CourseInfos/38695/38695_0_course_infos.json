    "This course is the continuation of the Algebra I course given by Dr. Dirk Kussin at TU Berlin in WS 21/22.",
    "Tuesday 12-14 MA 042",
    "Thursday 10-12 EMH 225",
    "Begin: April 16",
    "The course Algebra I explained the basic notions of algebra: groups, rings, fields, factor structures, and provided a fairly",
    "detailed treatment of algebraic field extensions, culminating in the beautiful Galois theory.",
    "The main goal of Algebra II is to provide an introduction to commutative algebra. This is the branch of algebra that studies",
    "commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings.",
    "Important examples of commutative rings are rings of algebraic integers (which includes the ring of integers)",
    "and polynomial rings over fields and their factor rings.",
    "Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. In fact, commutative algebra provides the tools for local studies in algebraic geometry, much like multivariate calculus is the main tool for local studies in differential geometry.",
    "The exercise sheets and other information will be uploaded",
