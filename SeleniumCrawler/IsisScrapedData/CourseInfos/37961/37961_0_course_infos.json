    "Welcome to the course \"",
    "Financial Mathematics I",
    "\" at TU Berlin. The lecturer is",
    "Professor Peter Bank",
    ".",
    "This is an overview over organizational matters concerning this course.",
    "CONTENTS",
    "In this course, we discuss the following",
    "contents",
    ":",
    "1. Arbitrage theory of (complete and incomplete) financial markets",
    "2. Martingale theory for the pricing and hedging of derivative instruments",
    "3. The Black-Scholes model as a scaling limit",
    "4. Utility theory and elements of stochastic control theory with financial applications",
    "5. Pricing and hedging in the Black-Scholes model",
    "As a",
    "prerequisite",
    "for following the course, you should feel comfortable with a) measure theory (Lebesgue theory, L^p spaces, Radon-Nikodym theorem), b) the basic theory of probability spaces (axiomatic foundation, basic distributions, elementary limit theorems, including the basic LLNs and CLT). Further, knowledge of c) elementary functional analysis (Hilbert spaces, Hahn-Banach theorem) is recommended, and of d) martingale theory in discrete time is strongly recommended.",
    "a) b) c) d) should be covered in the courses \"Analysis III\" (or \"Maßtheorie\"), \"Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie I\", \"Funktionalanalysis I\", \"Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie II\", respectively.",
    "COURSE FORMAT",
    "The course consists of",
    "two consecutive lectures per week complemented by one exercise class per week",
    ". The course is part of the BMS curriculum and will be taught in English. Lectures and exercise classes take place in presence unless announced otherwise. There are two time slots for the exercise class per week.",
    "Weekly exercises are uploaded on ISIS and you can hand in your solutions to the course's assistant (Franziska Bielert) either on written paper or as a LaTeX-compiled .pdf-document by email until some fixed due date. She is then going to correct them and return these corrections to you in due time.",
    "The",
    "exercise classes",
    "are conducted by the course's assistant. They are organised as follows: Students are supposed to prepare their questions regarding a) the course's contents, b) the preceding exercises, c) the solutions to them. During the exercise classes, you can ask these questions precisely and they will be discussed together. Drafts of solutions will be presented on the blackboard. If you wish a specific issue to be discussed in more detail, please let Franziska Bielert know about this in advance.",
    "The",
    "lectures take place on Modays from 10:15 AM to 11:45 AM in BH-N 243 and on Tuesdays from 16:15 AM to 18:45 AM also in BH-N 243",
    "; and the",
    "exercise classes on Tuesdays from 12:15-13:45 in H3010 and from 14:15-15:45 in MA550.",
    ". Lectures start on 15 April. Exercise classes start in the week of 22 April. One exercise class will be held in German, the other in English - details will be determined as the need arises.",
    "EXAMINATION AND FEEDBACK",
    "There will be altogether about 11 sheets of",
    "homework",
    ", each of which having a total score of 20 points. You are expected to obtain at least 50 % of the total score throughout the entire semester. Homework has to be returned until Monday before the lecture, beginning on 24 October. You can work in fixed groups (recommended group size: two). Please label your homework with the respective names, matriculation numbers, and date of return. The corrected exercises will be returned in the same way as they were handed in (in written form or as an annotated .pdf by email).",
    "Only answers which are",
    "formally acceptable (well legible, intellegibly formulated)",
    "will be considered. Please explain your answers in a succinct, though sufficient manner;",
    "be precise where you have to, stay concise where you can",
    ". Following mathematical convention, answers have to be formulated in complete sentences of either German or English language containing mathematical expressions and formulae, symbols you introduce must be declared and non-elementary results you refer to in a substantial way clearly mentioned.",
    "The course \"Finanzmathematik I\" (10 LP) can be validated through an",
    "oral examination",
    "at the end of the semester.  More details will be announced in June.",

    "One way to use them would be to",
    "1.  print out the next couple of slides before each lecture (maybe two slides per page);",
    "2.  read or at least skim these slides",
    "before",
    "each lecture;",
    "3.  fill in the blanks (most notably the proofs) as we discuss them in class; have extra sheets of paper ready for this;",
    "4.  collect your notes with the slides in a folder to have a complete set of lecture notes in the end.",
