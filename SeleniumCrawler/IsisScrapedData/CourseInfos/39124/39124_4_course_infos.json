    "﻿Dear all,",
    "Thank you for submitting your papers last week. We are still reading them and will get back to you on this within the next week. As our practical phase comes nearer, there are some news and practical informations to share with you.",
    "General Information",
    "Unfortunately the concrete sawing is taking much longer than expected at the construction site. This is not unusual in such projects and reflects the difficult reality of reusing structural parts today. For us, this means that unfortunately we will not be able to do the planned prototypes using plates within the timeline of the course. We are really sorry about that and a bit frustrated ourselves, as we were really looking forward to doing this with you.",
    "New Plan for Prototypes",
    "We have all materials for Teams B and C (see Miro) and propose to reshuffle the teams so that everyone of you will be able to participate in the reduced amount of experiments. Please see the proposed distribution on the Miro and contact us if the new arrangements are difficult for you.",
    "Teams & Dates",
    "Team B (Sucheta, Dilara, Wiktor) 09.07 - Mixture and forming RC Concrete",
    "Team C (Gema?, Adriana, Gabriel) 10.07 - Material sorting and mixture def. Concrete Rubble",
    "Team C (Adriana, Yuliya?) 11.07 - Mixture and forming Concrete Rubble",
    "Team D (Fernando, Brandon, Yuki) 17.07. - Pressure tests",
    "Team E (Takumi, Lucie, Theo) 19.07 - Pressure tests",
    "Logistics and Equipment",
    "The days in the lab will start at 09:30 and will take us around 3 hours in the morning each day mentioned. We will meet at Georg-Hermann-Allee (coordinates 52.412845698245235, 13.049291672803694). Please be on time. If you are only available in the afternoon on certain days, let us know.",
    "In the lab, security equipment is mandatory and especially security shoes and goggles. If you do not own these, please let us know which size shoes you need and Rosa will try to lend you these from the Bauhaus Earth stock.",
    "Documentation",
    "We will provide you with a template for documenting the experiments until beginning of next week. As we reshuffled the teams, you are free to arrange and coordinate between you on specific tasks.",
    "Doc 1: Sucheta, Dilara, Wiktor, Fernande, Brandon, Yuki",
    "Doc 2: Gema, Adriana, Gabriel, Yuliya, Takumi, Lucie, Theo",
    "Finals 12.07. 10:00-12:00 ROOM 508",
    "On 12.07. Prof. Misselwitz and Prof. Hagemann will join us to have a look at the course results. We would like to give you the chance to present some of your results but most of all to discuss the challenges of concrete reuse and opportunities you may have found more in a workshop format than a formal presentation.",
    "This means that each group (the original groups 1-5) will need to define one thesis drawn from your analysis and present it within 5min. The Thesis should challenge current practices and show a way forward in reuse practice of concrete - do not hesitate to make critical claims. To make an example, one such thesis could be „exploration of friction based instead of metal based connections is promising for reuse applications“ or „reuse of steel reinforcements in concrete is not worthwhile“. You may support your argument with images and Grafs from your papers, but should not need to research or prepare anything much additionally to what you already have. The goal is rather to extract the most interesting thought from your findings.",
    "Additionally to the presenter each team should define a respondent, that will react to the thesis presented by the other groups to start a discussion after the presentation.",
    "The Professors and teaching staff will form an inner ring of discussion with the respondents. The presenters will join this ring one after the other. We will have 5min presentation + 15min discussion and questions from the „inner ring“ for each team.",
    "If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact us.",
    "Looking forward to meeting you all again soon!",
    "Ioan, Christian, Rosa and David"
