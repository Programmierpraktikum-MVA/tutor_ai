    "Unlike any other modern building material, concrete has made it \npossible to build cheaper, higher and faster than ever before. From the \nhidden hero of ever more daring primary structures to a visible element \nof architectural design, it is omnipresent in today’s built environment.\n At the same time it is emblematic of the environmental challenges \nfacing the building industry: although we know how carbon- and \nextraction-intensive the material is, we are still struggling to reuse \nit on a large scale.",
    "To put things in perspective: within the last 50 years roughly 80 \nresearch and construction projects were realized reusing concrete \nstructures worldwide, while in the first half of 2023 more than 135.000 \nbuilding permits were issued in Germany alone. What are the systemic \nconstraints and critics of reusing concrete? How to take the current \ncall to stop demolishing and new construction into practice and \nsolutions?",
    "The research project \"concrete.matters\" conducted by Baukreisel, aims\n to investigate the possibilities of massively scaling the reuse of \ndeconstructed primary concrete structures in transformation and new \nconstruction, while reflecting on existing research references, \npractitioners and projects. This exploration involves constructing 1:1 \nmock-ups that showcase a number of different approaches and reuse \noptions to be reviewed and compared, thus defining an \"Optimal Reuse \nCase\" (ORC),  which may prove to be more advantageous when compared to \nbusiness as usual. The ORC is defined simultaneously by environmental, \neconomic, and social criteria compared to the usability rate of the \nreused structure.",
    "During the seminar, you will be able to participate in this \nresearch effort, mapping stakeholders and flows, from understanding \ncurrent limitations, to documenting and assessing state-of-the art \ntechniques and participating in the building process of the prototypes \nat Bauhaus Earth's Marienpark Lab.",
    "The seminar will be structured in two modules:",
    "Module 1 (6 weeks, 13.05 – 21.06)  Applied research and material experiments",
    "Baukreisel\n and Bauhaus Earth will provide a defined set of experimental mock-up \noptions to be compared within the ORC framework and with current \nexperts. Students will then work in small groups to test these ideas \nthrough 'table-top scale' experiments, having previously developed the \ndetails needed to carry them out. Topics to be explored include \nadditional carbonation, alkaline binders, design for disassembly, carbon\n fibre reinforcements, etc.",
    "Module 2 (8 weeks, 24.06 – 16.08) 1:1 Mock-up and process documentation",
    "Using\n the results from the first module, 1:1 mock-ups will be built at the \nBauhaus Earth LAB in Marienpark. Students will be able to experience and\n test the process first hand, document it and participate in the open \nreflection on the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen approaches.\n They will also be introduced to the building realities that will emerge\n from the research project.",

    "Baukreisel",
    ",\n one of the current BE-FELLOWs, is an interdisciplinary collective \ncomprising architects, social scientists and economists with the common \naim to radically increase the reuse of building materials, as a lever to\n reduce the gigantic footprint of the building industry in a short \nperiod of time. Their activities range from architectural practice to \nresearch (“reuse.matters”) as well as formal and informal teaching \n(“reuse.practice”) in the architectural field.",
