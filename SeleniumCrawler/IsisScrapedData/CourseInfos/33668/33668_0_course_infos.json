    "Dear Students and Robotics Enthusiasts,",
    "We now have 4 strong robotics labs at TUB in Marchstr.! And with that we would like to build up our range of teaching, projects, jobs, and lab access that we can offer to students. We want to use this page as the central information source for students that aim to study robotics and work with robots at TUB.",
