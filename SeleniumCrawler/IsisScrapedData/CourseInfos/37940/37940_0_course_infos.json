    "Learning Outcomes",
    "Students acquire methods and skills to solve a scientific \nquestion in the area of network information systems. They can formulate \nscientific questions as well as to proof or disprove a hypothesis in \nthis field. In particular, they can systematically\n            produce and publish results to validate the thesis and \nderive conclusions for further studies in this research area. \nFurthermore, students are able to pursue research approaches \nindependently and to critically review related work in this field.",
    "Content",
    "Network information systems are continuously improved to \nconnect an ever-increasing number of computing devices and to fulfil a \nwide range of different requirements. In particular, higher throughput, \nlower latency, and higher reliability paved\n            the the way for future application scenarios, e.g., \naugmented reality, autonomous driving, and reliable industrial \ncommunication. However, new use cases often come with new requirements \nimplying that wireless communication systems need to\n            be adapted continuously. In the project, students will \ndevelop solutions for selected topics in the area of network information\n systems. Students work with a member of our institute on a current \nresearch topic. In particular, students will\n            design, implement, and evaluate prototypes improving network\n information systems.",
