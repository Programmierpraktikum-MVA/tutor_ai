    "Getting in shape: Watching microbial colonies grow in complex spaces",
    "Abstract:",
    "Many bacteria inhabit complex environments, such as 3D porous media (e.g., subsurface soils and sediments) and polymeric fluids (e.g., gels and tissues in the body, environmental polysaccharides, and extracellular polymers in biofilms). However, lab studies typically focus on cells in bulk simple fluids or on flat 2D surfaces. How does inhabiting a more complex 3D space change how bacteria behave? In this talk, I will describe some examples from my group's work addressing this question. In particular, by combining tools from soft matter engineering, 3D imaging, and biophysical modeling, we show that interactions with their complex environments shape a fundamental feature of bacterial lifeâ€”how they proliferate in space in multicellular colonies."
