    "You are required to read and comment on a number of selected texts. We will grade your comments for 30% of the overall grade. To support this practice, we use the website Perusall (",
    "https://www.perusall.com/",
    "). Please setup yourself an account there and register to the code with the following access code:",
    "UNGUREANU-VNKHN",
    "Please enter your student number as 'student ID' (Immatrikulationsnummer) in your profile so that we can trace your grades.",
    "We grade the comments according to the following schema:",
    "We rate every comment on a scale from 0 to 2:",
    "0 - we do not see any direct relation to the content of the text",
    "1 - the comment repeats some of the content of the text",
    "2 - the comment shows some level of reflection about the content (this includes questions and answers to questions)",
    "Then we count the best 7 comments and interpolate them to the amount of portfolio points. We subtract some portfolio points if the comments are not evenly distributed across the text.",
    "The 10 reading assignments are associated with a lecture, as indicated in the Syllabus overview. The deadline for each reading assignment is 24 hours before the associated lecture, which is reflected in the deadlines set in Perusall. Each reading will be discussed during the indicated lecture.",
