    "It is largely unknown, but throughout its history Berlin was also an \nimportant center of chemistry. Particularly during the development of \nthe phlogiston theory in the first half of the 18th century and in the \ntime of August Wilhelm Hofmann and Emil Fischer between around 1865 and \n1920, Berlin can even be viewed as the most important international \ncenter of chemistry. The chemical industry was also once important here.\n This is evidenced by once well-known company names such as Schering, \nAgfa, Riedel de Haen, Kahlbaum and Kunheim. However, there are only a \nfew traces of this left.",
    "This richly illustrated lecture follows\n these traces of “The Chemical Berlin”. From Kunckel's laboratory on \nPfaueninsel to the Bear Pharmacy in the Nikolaiviertel, where several \nchemical elements were discovered, and to the various locations of \nchemical institutes and manufacturing plants, the past is compared with \nwhat we see today at these places."
