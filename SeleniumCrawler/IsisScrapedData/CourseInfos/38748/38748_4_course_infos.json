    "My talk explores the intersection of astronomy,\ncolonialism, and personal experiences during the eighteenth century, focusing\non the travelogs of astronomers Jacques-André Mallet and Jean-Louis Pictet.\nDuring their 1768-1769 missions to the Kola Peninsula, commissioned by the St.\nPetersburg Academy to observe the rare transit of Venus across the Sun, Mallet\nand Pictet made significant scientific contributions. However, their travelogs\nreveal a stark contrast between the scientific publications and personal impressions.\nThe reluctance of Catherine the Great, influenced by a literary conflict with\nFrench astronomer Jean Baptiste Chappe d’Autroche, underscores the political\ndynamics. A comparative analysis between Chappe d’Autroche and Mallet / Pictet\nsheds light on the colonial nature of relations, exposing social stratification\nwithin the metropole, provinces, and among different ethnic groups. This talk\nunravels the complexities of Russian colonialism and provides insights into\nsocietal dynamics, scientific exploration, and power structures in the\neighteenth century.",
