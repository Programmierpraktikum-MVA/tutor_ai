    "View Synthesis (image-based rendering) and 3D reconstruction of persons,\n    objects and scenes is applied in many areas such as media production,\n    video communication, as well as in the industrial and medical sector.\n    New visualization techniques, like Virtual and Augmented Reality offer\n    completely new application scenarios. After an introduction on camera\n    model and stereo geometry, this lecture is concerned with extended\n    analysis of the geometry of multiple views. A detailed overview on novel\n    view synthesis and 3D reconstruction is given, with a strong link to\n    recent results achieved in current research projects at Fraunhofer\n    Heinrich Hertz Institute.",
