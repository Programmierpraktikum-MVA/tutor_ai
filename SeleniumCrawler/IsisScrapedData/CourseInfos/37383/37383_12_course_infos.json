    "First time working with R? To get started, follow the tutorial we prepared for the installation.",
    "If you already know how to install them or you already have the tools installed, check the URLs we included to download the latest versions of R and R Studio. Since with every new release, the packages are also updated, it is a good practice to install/ update and use the latest version of the tools. If you choose not to do it, you might run into some troubles with the installation of the required packages.",
    "For newcomers as well for those which already worked with R, we included a video-based online tutorial resource which you can follow at your own pace. It serves as a booster for the newcomers and as a refresher for the previously-initiated. We recommend you to follow it in the first two weeks of the class, before starting with the projects. The time effort required to complete it is 4 to 5 hours in total (usually estimated for newcomers).",
