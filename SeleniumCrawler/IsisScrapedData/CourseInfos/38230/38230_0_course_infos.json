    "This seminar is intended for advanced bachelor and master level students with a",
    "background in (infinite-dimensional) control theory and optimization",
    ". The goal is to provide an overview of ongoing research activities in the fields of",
    "control theory, model order reduction, data-driven approximations and PDE constrained optimization",
    ".",
    "Procedure",
    "Each seminar participant is expected to study and present a research topic (see the list below) and to write a short summary of the main results. Participation in the seminar is limited to 12 students.",
    "Signing up for the seminar:",
    "Interested students choose (at most) 3 out of these 12 articles and send an email to me with the corresponding titles (with or without a ranking for preferences) until April 15, 2024.",
    "I will distribute the articles based on the replies and prepare a list of seminar participants until April 21, 2024. Please note that participation in the seminar is not based on a first-come, first-served basis but on the particular topical availability/thematical fit.",
    "A first meeting with the participants in order to discuss questions will be held in the week of April 22, 2024.",
    "Only one student per topic.",
    "The presentations will be held in presence in a block format at 2 days towards the end of the semester, most likely Monday, July 1 and Monday, July 8. The exact slots will be specified once the topics have been distributed.",
    "Participants are expected to attend all the presentations.",
    "Each participant has to submit a summary of the main results (up to 5 pages) by July 26, 2024.",
