    "At first, a suitable replacement will be determined by comparing the most commonly",
    "used persistence solutions in the Java environment. Performance tests",
    "and other metrics will be taken into account. After a replacement has been determined,",
    "the legacy application VISITE will be migrated to use the new ORM",
    "tool. The necessary steps will be documented and any occurring problem discussed.",
    "Several test iterations will be performed until the application is ready",
    "to be tested in a semi-productive environment. In the end, an outlook on the",
    "required future maintenance work will be given."
