    "\"In 1947, Karl Weissenberg published a paper discussing the ability of some fluids to climb a spinning rod. This phenomena, commonly referred to as the \"Weissenberg Effect,\" has an elusive reasoning that requires at least a basic understanding of fluid characteristics and behaviors.  This video, created for an extra credit assignment for University of Tennessee Chemical Engineering student Christopher Neal's Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer class, discusses those basic fluid behaviors and seeks to describe the way that pseudoplastics conglomerate around and climb a spinning rod exposed to rotational shearing.\"",

    "Rheology describes the molecular and supermolecular dynamics of complex materials. It is one of the most sensitive indicators of changes in a material while it also determines the processing and end-use of many materials. While rheological knowledge has advanced significantly over the last decade, it remained difficult to access and has rarely been applied to its full potential. In response to this problem, Winter and Mours (see Rheologica Acta articles, 2006 and 2022) created a software platform for the world’s leading rheologists to share their work with a wider community of materials researchers and practitioners.",
    "Global sharing of rheology software through Rheo-Hub (picture from Amhrst Rheology Course, June 2005). The user (student, researcher, practitioner, etc.) enters a virtual environment that instantly activates a research scenario in which he/she can explore authentic research questions, follow up on thought experiments, ask what-if questions and visualize results before continuing to further analysis and exploration. Software codes and documentation from each of the rheology expert groups are represented by one or more software “engines” which are connected to a domain platform on the users’ laptops...",

    "RepTate (Rheology of Entangled Polymers: Toolkit for Analysis of Theory & Experiment) is a software package for viewing, exchanging and analysing rheological data. Several of the classical and latest theories of polymer dynamics are included in RepTate, so they can be tested and fitted to the experimental data.",
    "RepTate was originally developed as a part of the Microscale Polymer Processing (muPP2) project funded by the EPSRC, back in 2006. The original Delphi code was developed by Jorge Ramirez and Alexei Likhtman and many collaborators at the University of Leeds. Some improvements and advanced features were added to the code while the authors were at the University of Reading. Many members of the muPP2 project (Richard Graham, Dietmar Auhl, Daniel Read, Kamakshi Jagannathan and Bart Vorselaars) added particular modules and theories to RepTate. We would also like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions and suggestions made by many muPP2 colleagues, in particular, Tom McLeish, Choon Chai, Ian Robinson, Sathish K. Sukumaran, Suneel Kunamaneni and Dietmar Auhl.",
    "The new RepTate is the result of a joint collaboration between Jorge Ramirez (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid), Victor Boudara and Daniel Read (University of Leeds) and has been developed in Python, which guarantees full compatibility in different OSs (Windows, Mac and Linux), using NumPy and SciPy for the numerics, Matplotlib for the plots, PySide6 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and codes in C for some of the theories.",
    "The main idea of RepTate is to create a platform which makes comparing theory and experiment much easier than ever before. In particular, we wanted a powerful and user-friendly software which",
    "can be installed on the same computer as the rheometer and does not require a theoretician in order to compare your latest experimental result with the latest theory;",
    "allows to introduce new data representation (view) in a few lines of code;",
    "allows to add new theory in a few lines of code (in addition to the theory calculation itself).",
