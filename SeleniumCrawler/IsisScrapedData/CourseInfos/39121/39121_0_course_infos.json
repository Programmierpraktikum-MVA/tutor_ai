    "This module introduces into advanced topics in wireless communication systems, preparing students to contribute to research projects during their master thesis in this as well as in related fields. The module covers MIMO techniques and adaptive transmission for multiple users in mobile scenarios. The focus is on the physical and medium access layers, and the support needed from the network layer.",

    "Students are expected to have a basic understanding of math, high frequency engineering  and telecommunications. They are ideally interested in the relation between theory and practical system design. Slides from last year are available below. Please, attend the lecture as well and contact me, in case of any questions, using my HHI email address, see below.",
    "The lecture takes place as a double course, 2x 90 minutes, with a lunch break inbetween, every Thursday 10-14 in the seminar room 023A which is on the ground floor at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Einsteinufer 37.  This is the tall building at the north corner of the north campus of TU berlin, near to the river, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Institute_for_Telecommunications",
