    "Micro-Credentials are specialized academic\nprograms offered by universities and colleges as supplementary fields of study.\nThey can range in scope from 18 to 30 ECTS credits. Micro-credentials emerged\nas a viable solution in today's era of increasing demand for interdisciplinary\neducation.",
    "What sets Micro-Credentials apart is their\nflexibility. They can be awarded by formal educational institutions and align\nwith the European and national qualification frameworks, including the ECTS\nsystem. Importantly, students pursuing Micro-Credentials do not necessarily\nneed to have completed their master's degree, and this program is open to\nstudents from any public university in Berlin, including FU, HU, and TU Berlin.\nThe European Union supports and encourages the implementation of\nMicro-Credentials, promoting their integration into existing qualification\nprograms.",
