    "What do the micro-personal habits of Mundby tell us about the formation of race, class, gender and sexuality? And how power and desire work in the imperial metropolis?",
    "What role does the urban (as well as other spaces like the mine, etc) play in Mundby’s walking observations? How does the urban fabric of the city shape or create his encounters and interactions with working class women?",
    "What does McClintock mean by the gendering of urban space?",
    "What subjectivities does the urban make possible (or prohibit)?",
    "Carby asks in the introduction to her text if it matters where the encounters between Africans and Europeans take place. How does she spatialize this tale of what she calls ‘everyday ties, relations and intricate interdependencies of empire and colonialism’?",
    "How do space and the built environment feature in telling the story of Carl and Iris? Does the space of their encounter matter, and if so, in what way?",
