    "1. Can we rewrite histories and counter narratives not only via text, but through the material environment?",
    "2. How does the built environment and materialities of cities also act as a sort of archive? If we see the city as a form of archive, what is missing or lost or less noticed?",
    "3. Like Roy and Lorde, Hartman talks about bending convention or operating outside of the rules of the 'historical guild'. How does she try to do this through narrative, and can we think of other ways that we can operate outside of conventions in a more material sense?",
