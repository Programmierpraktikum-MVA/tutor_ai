    "Focussing primarily on urban spaces in Europe and\nthe Global North, this course will work to develop a critical knowledge of",
    "how race, class, gender, sexuality are being produced\nboth in and through urban space. We will explore how the intersection of these\npositions produces complex, shifting subjectivities, political configurations\nand urban struggles. It will draw on a wide range of scholarship, including on\ncritical race theory, feminist geographers, postcolonial and queer theory in\norder to examine how power is employed and contested across city spaces and how\nstructural inequalities and ambivalent subjectivites are produced. Moving\nacross the macro, meso and micro levels, we will examine how some individuals\nmobilise citizenship, class privilege or whiteness to protect themselves, gain\nadvantage and navigate hierarchical structures and everyday disadvantage. Meanwhile,\nhow do structural phenomenon like racial and colonial capitalism, queer and\ntransphobia, or class hierarchies interact with urban spaces and who can access\nthem and flourish?",
    "This\ncourse will aim to deconstruct blackness (and conversely whiteness) as\nhomogeneous experiences, whilst linking these constructions and their lived\nexperiences back to socio-spatial processes like gentrification. We will\ncritically interrogate how some subjects can become subjects of value in\nneoliberal capitalism, whilst others are produced as superfluous and rendered\nultimately disposable.",
