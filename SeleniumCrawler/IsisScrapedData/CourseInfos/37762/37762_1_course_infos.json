    "Each week several students will lead the discussion by responding to the questions given on the text for that week. Each student should lead one discussion. Along with leading the small group discussion, students must also submit a written three-to-four-page reflection (approximately 1,500-2,500 words) focussing on one week and the discussion questions for that week. Students can also construct their own arguments based on the readings, or juxtapose two or three weeks together; the essential factor is that students can critically engage with the texts and present an original point of view. Please email or speak to me after class if you would like help with your essay topic.",
    "The essay is due by September 1st."
