    "Welcome to the course page for the Bachelor/Master modules (Advanced) Blockchain Prototyping (ISE), (Advanced) Cloud Prototyping, (Advanced) Distributed Systems Prototyping (3S), and (Advanced) Information Systems Prototyping (IKM)!",
    "In these courses, students have hands-on experience with all \naspects of software project work (including team-based software \ndevelopment, project management, collaborative decision making, \ndocumenting and communicating project results) in the area of \ndistributed systems. They are able to solve real-world problems in the \ncontext of the design, implementation, and evaluation of cloud-, fog-, \nblockchain-, and/or web-based application systems in, e.g., enterprise, \nstart-up, and IoT contexts.",
    "Small groups of students analyze and solve challenging software\n and prototyping problems. They explore and use public cloud services, \ne.g., Amazon Web Services, and modern software (Web, blockchain, mobile,\n and other) technology stacks as applicable to the specific project \nfocus defined in each term. The student teams work independently and are\n supervised by participating research groups. Hands-on experimentation \nwith cloud services and open source systems is expected. Concrete tasks \nand project objectives as regards themes and technology stacks will be \ncommunicated at the beginning of the term. Some projects may be in \ncooperation with external partners.",
    "Here you will find all information regarding \nupcoming projects. For this term, several projects will be offered by \ndifferent research groups. Note that each project is part of a different formal module, which is relevant if you have already completed a specific module or plan to take part in multiple projects this semester. Detailed information about each project are posted below.",
