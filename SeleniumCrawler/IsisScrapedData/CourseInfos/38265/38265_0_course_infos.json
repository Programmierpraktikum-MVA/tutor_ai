    "Computational models are a powerful scientific and engineering tool and there are plenty of courses in which you can learn about existing models in many domains of science. But what do you do when none of these models fit your problem? You have to invent your own, hand-tailored model or modify an existing one. Many students and researchers find that this is not an easy problem, because it requires a very different skill set than the analysis of a given, pre-defined model. That's unfortunate because the development of a suitable model for your problem is obviously quite important, and because - once you've mastered that skill - it's the most fun and creative part of modelling.",
    "The goal of this course is to give you a toolkit and practical experience in the development of computational models. Modelling is a bit like playing Lego. There is a relatively limited number of basic mathematical building blocks that can be combined in infinitely many ways. In short lectures, we will introduce you to some of these building blocks. Afterwards, you get to apply them by developing your own models for different example problems. We'll help you in the process. Because that requires close personal supervision, we can only admit 25 students. It also means that the course cannot be attended online.",
    "Enrolment:",
    "The course is targeted at students from all disciplines, but you will need a solid mathematical basis. That's why we kindly ask you to take a short",
    "math test",
    "before we admit you to the course. Please understand that we may not admit you, either because we have too many applications and we need to admit students at random, or because we think that you would be overwhelmed by the math. We'll also factor in whether you need seminar credits to advance your studies.",

    "Pen and paper. If you prefer to write on a tablet, that's ok.",
    "No computer. Maybe we will have small coding sessions later, but at the beginning, it will only distract you.",
