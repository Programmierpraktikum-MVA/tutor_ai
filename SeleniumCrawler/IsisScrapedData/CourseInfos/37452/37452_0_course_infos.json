    "Inverse problems occur in many real world application areas such as physics, material sciences, medical imaging or geosciences, thus have attracted many mathematicians' interests from the past decades. Normally, these problems are modeled by certain differential equations with multiple parameters, and the inverse problems are focused on the reconstruction of the unknown parameters from the measurements of the",

    "do not hold. What's worse, these inverse problems are usually non-linear. Thus special measures, such as regularization or linearization, have to be applied in order develop efficient numerical methods. We will go through the regularization technique for both linear inverse problems, and nonlinear ones combined with the linearization technique in this lecture. Despite the universal tools to solve general inverse problems, we will also introduce the Radon transformation method and the factorization method, which are particular high efficient methods in the fields of computational tomography (CT) and Electrical impedance tomography (EIT).",
