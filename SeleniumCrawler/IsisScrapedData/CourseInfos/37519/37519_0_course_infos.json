    "There is a maximum number of participants. If more students are interested in the course, places are assigned randomly.",
    "Quantitative studies of behavior are fundamental in understanding how intelligence emerges among animals. Recent advances in deep learning and computer vision made it increasingly possible to monitor and analyze behavior with unprecedented detail. This, in turn, led to a rapid advancement in the field, providing the acquisition of rich data representations of behavior. However, these advancements present the challenge of deriving meaning from the large volumes of obtained data.",
    "This course provides participants with a hands-on introduction to the end-to-end analysis of animal behavior, from processing video recordings to characterizing & modeling behavior. Participants will be introduced to the mathematical tools necessary to understand the basics of tracking (using deep learning & convolutional neural networks to extract keypoints in 2 dimensions, and triangulating into 3 dimensions), state estimation (using (nonlinear) Kalman filters), and characterization of behavior on a week-to-week basis in the form of lectures. Since these topics cover many different disciplines, the focus will be put on gaining a high-level understanding of each of the topics. Furthermore, various renowned scientists will be invited to present state-of-the-art methods, research, and widely used open-source tools in computer vision, computational ethology, and behavioral sciences. These lectures serve to teach and inspire participants about what current research has to offer, as well as to demonstrate fruitful collaborations in highly interdisciplinary science.",
    "Participants are expected to deliver a report and give a presentation at the end of the semester. The main objective of the projects is to get the participants acquainted with behavioral data and gain practical experience with the necessary tools.",
    "The projects are a central element of this course. Not only will participants gain hands-on experience with analyzing real data, but they will furthermore learn about the research conducted within Science of Intelligence excellence cluster.",

    "Note 2: the old ethograms file had a shape of [2, 4, 24188]. This is since the original videos had 24188 frames. The videos were cut since the trial ends when the mouse starts eating the reward. Both the old ethogram file and this one are fine to use for your pipeline, but please keep in mind that you only should compare your pipeline results with the ethograms up to point where the mouse eats the reward (frame 16650).",
