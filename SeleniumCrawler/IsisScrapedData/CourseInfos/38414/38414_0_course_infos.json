    "In principle, in project courses given by the CV&RS research group, participants will gain significant insights into computer vision related problems and solutions. The goal is not to explore the whole field of research completely, but rather to confront the participants with the full complexity of one specific problem and to challenge their own initiative. Therefore, we do not provide a pedagogically gentle introduction of the learners to the scientific area, but we allow insights and participation in research and development.",
    "The ability of the participants to work in a team shall be improved by this module.",
