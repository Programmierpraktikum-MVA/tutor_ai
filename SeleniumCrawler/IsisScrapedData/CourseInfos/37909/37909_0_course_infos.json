    "The module comprises a distinguished speaker series, with six \ninternational experts coming to Berlin to give a lecture each. The \nexperts are recruited from the fields of neuroscience, machine learning,\n robotics, behavioral biology, psychology, and philosophy. Prefacing the\n distinguished speaker series, the participants will be introduced to \nthe fundamentals of science communication and scientific storytelling. \nThey will then apply the learned knowledge by conducting short \ninterviews in groups with one of the invited experts. Those interviews \nwill be complemented by further interviewing one SCIoI-internal expert \nwith a similar field of expertise. The participants will then, under \nguidance, write a podcasting script, process the interviews, record \ntheir own material, and then finally produce a short science podcast \nseries, with each group contributing one episode. The podcast will be \nreleased on common podcasting platforms.",
