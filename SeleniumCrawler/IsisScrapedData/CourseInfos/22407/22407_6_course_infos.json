    "Regarding the last part of the assignment 1 in the Lab2  (page 5), which you are asked to repeat it for different operating points, you can simulate the circuit with I_ bias= 200uA and I_bias=300uA. You should change the 100uA reference current or ratio of the current mirror and please do not forget to scale the size of the M1 by 2X and 3X. You can change the multiplier property, which is normally set as 1, to 2 or 3 to scale the total width of the MOSFET.",
    "If you already submitted the lab assignment, it would be no need to change something and resubmit, since my announcement was late!",
