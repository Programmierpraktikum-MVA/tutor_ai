    "This course will be delivered in English in a series of interactive in person and online sessions. Scheduling to be determined.",
    "Multiple aspects of the hydrogen energy economy will be critically examined with and emphasis on the role of ceramic materials in system functionality.",
    "Specifically the following aspects will be addressed:",
    "The Hydrogen economy and its development",
    "Hydrogen production from hydrocarbons",
    "Hydrogen production from water splitting",
    "Solar and thermal aspects of hydrogen production",
    "Material challenges for photocatalysis based hydrogen generation",
    "Hydrogen storage and transport",
    "Fuel cells",
    "Materials and processing for solid oxide fuel cells",
    "Fusion energy systems",
    "Students are expected to gain new insights into these aspects and specifically to understand how the physical properties of ceramic materials play a role in applied systems in the Hydrogen economy.",
    "The scope of manufacturing of ceramics for H energy systems is quite limited while the research in this field is intensive. Students will produce there own work in the form of a presentation and report.",
    "Assessment will be based on a presentation and a short exam. Details will be provided during our first session.",
