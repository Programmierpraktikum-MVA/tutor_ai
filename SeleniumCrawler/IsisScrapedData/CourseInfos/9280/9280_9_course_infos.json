    "Here we will look at some emerging concepts relating to energy generation based on the fusion of hydrogen isotopes.",
    "While the challenges are large, this approach offers huge rewards in the form of tremendously high power generation without the challenges of large scale storage of hydrogen.",
    "We will try to better understand the fundamental challenges to achieving fusion systems and the materials that enable such reactors.",
