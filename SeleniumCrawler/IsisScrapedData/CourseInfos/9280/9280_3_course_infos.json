    "As a major part of this course, students will conduct independent literature based research into materials and their application for hydrogen energy systems. Presentations should be 15 -20 minutes in length, with an additional 3 - 5 minutes allocated for questions from peers. these sessions will be held in February 2024",
    "Student projects should have a well defined scope e.g. a particular type of material or material processing technique. But should also rely on at least 5 independent sources (i.e. not a bunch of paper all from the same research group).",
    "For this presentation you should examine the following:",
    "- Materials synthesis and processing",
    "- Physical and chemical mechanisms of material performance",
    "- Economic aspects of production and use",
    "- Implementation and efficiency",
    "- Comparative analysis with related systems",
    "- Challenges and current research trends",
    "- Outlook",
    "Please see the attached surveys to select your theme, to avoid excessive overlap between presentations.",
    "Presentations will be graded according to the following criteria",
    "Interesting and Informative",
    "Quality of slides and presentation",
    "Scientific depth",
    "Clarity",
