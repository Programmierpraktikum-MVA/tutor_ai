    "The first meeting will take place on Thursday,",
    "18.04.2024",
    "at 14:15.",
    "In this seminar, we will explore several topics related to Gibbs measures in statistical mechanics, from the classical results of D. Ruelle and R.L. Dobrushin in the ‘60s to the state of the art in Gibbs point process theory.",
    "After the seminar, interested students will also be able to ask",
    "Professor W. König",
    "and me for a Bachelor’s/Master’s thesis.",
