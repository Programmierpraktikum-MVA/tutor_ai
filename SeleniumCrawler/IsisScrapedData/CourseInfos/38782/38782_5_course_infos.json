    "Plain bearings are used to prevent direct contact, e.g. between shaft and housing, so that they do not wear out. Most bearings require regular lubrication to function properly. iglidur plain bearings do not require additional lubricants. They are therefore maintenance-free and represent a cost-effective alternative to metal plain bearings. They are available in various types and in more than 10,000 sizes in our",

    "All iglidur materials consist of three components: base polymers, fibres and fillers, solid lubricants. As it is not possible for one universal material to fulfil all tasks equally well, there are different iglidur materials. Each has a different composition of the three components and a different application area.",
