    "The place of Open Source in innovation",
    "This lecture is derived from a study commissioned by DG CONNECT of the European Commission to investigate the different dimensions of the economic impact of Open Source software and hardware on the European economy. Taken together, the sources upon which this study is based provide a comprehensive picture of the current commercial uses, costs and benefits of Open Source software, as well as global policy efforts thus far to utilize and magnify the benefits of using OSS. Using this information, the study describes the potential for the EU to achieve policy goals through the use, promotion and support of FOSS, and, to a lesser extent, Open Source hardware.",
