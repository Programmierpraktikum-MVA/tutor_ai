    "Software stacks, license compliance and license compatibility",
    "License compliance is an important requirement for anybody distributing FOSS. A key aspect of license compliance is license compatibility, the need for the obligations from all licenses combined in the product to be fulfilled at the same time. This can lead to complications if inbound licenses contain terms that contradict each other, or if the outbound license chosen by the distributor contradicts an inbound license.",
    "The terms of FOSS licenses are offered as-is. We will discuss the concepts of non-negotiability and the condition of non-violation as working principles of FOSS licenses.",
    "The session concludes with a review of the details of the Open Source Definition and of the most widely used FOSS licenses.",
