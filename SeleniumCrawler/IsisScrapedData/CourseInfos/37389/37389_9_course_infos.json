    "Real-life Open Source compliance",
    "We established that FOSS compliance is paramount for business continuity and at the same time potentially complex because of the large amounts of both FOSS and proprietary software modules embedded in modern products. The inter-disciplinary character of FOSS that touches on business or managerial, legal and technological aspects adds to this complexity.",
    "The ecosystem manages it by applying well-defined formats, standardizing supply chain processes and developing tooling for automation. These are complemented by best practise recommendations developed by the community.",
    "FOSS business strategy - differentiate or collaborate",
    "In the light of the apparent conflict between the societal benefit of Open Source products and an equilibrium price of zero that limits the options to earn an income from the creation of informationÂ goods, the question for what business models can be applied to peer production has been asked repeatedly.",
    "One of the reasons why it has not been answered satisfyingly is because the term business model is used in varying contexts or meanings. The term is ubiquitous, but maybe this is the wrong question to ask? We are going to discuss it and suggest a more systematic approach based on strategy and tactics. We then look at existing companies that produce or service Open Source products and how they manage to generate revenue based off a free product.",
    "In a brief overview, a number of popular types of commercial Open Source offerings will be discussed - commercialisation of existing FOSS products, freemium, distribution-and-services (as a modern form of the razor-and-blades sales approach), multi-licensing, and others. Besides the competitive promise of the approaches, the acceptance of such commercial behaviour by Open Source contributors will be evaluated.",
    "In this session the focus will be on competitive activities, whereas cooperative approaches will be discussed in the next one.",
