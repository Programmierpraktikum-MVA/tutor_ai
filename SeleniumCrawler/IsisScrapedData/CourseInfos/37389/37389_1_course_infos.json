    "Course overview, and Introduction: The economics of Free and Open Source Software",
    "In the first session, following the course overview, we are going to discuss the three main elements of the problem space covered by this course - Open Source, intellectual property and intellectual property rights, and the idea of the digital society.",
    "We begin with a brief overview over the history of Open Source, how it is developed and organised today, and how the Free Software and Open Source movements relate to each other. Communities that are used as case studies throughout the course will be introduced.",
    "After that, concepts of intellectual property and rights to knowledge will be introduced. After a brief critique of the term “intellectual property” itself, the focus will be on what the motivation of society is to create such protective rights for intangible goods.",
    "Finally, we will ask what makes society digital. From the technical changes induced by the emergence of the internet, the effect the internet has on markets for information good will be discussed. The session ends with a breakdown of the dilemma regulators face when trying to balance the demands for protection of the freedom and rights of internet users against the demands to protect the viability of the information good producing industries.",
