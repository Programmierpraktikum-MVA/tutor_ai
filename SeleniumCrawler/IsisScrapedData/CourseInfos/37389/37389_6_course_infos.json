    "Open source licensing and derivative works",
    "One of the most central topics of Open Source is licensing. Licensing determines the ground rules of sharing, re-use and the creation of derivative works in collaborative processes. Based on copyright, licensing is one of the mechanisms that influences the organisation of peer production. In turn, peer production reflects back on existing formal protective rights, for example in the discussion about copyright terms and breadth. Open Source licenses provide templates for individual licensing contracts, de-facto standardising licensing terms and conditions. In particular, Open Source licenses cause positive externalities if bundles of related products standardise on similar or the same licenses, highlighting the importance of license compatibility. We will discuss and structure the most commonly used Open Source licenses, see how the licenses affect the creation of derivative works, and how licenses are used in whole distributions of software systems and more complex software stacks.",
