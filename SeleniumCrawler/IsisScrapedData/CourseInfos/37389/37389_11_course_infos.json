    "Cooperative strategies - Open Source foundations",
    "A number of large and economically important peer produced products are created under a cooperative as opposed to a competitive model, like the Linux kernel or Eclipse. Commercial entities invest into these products apparently without a direct benefit. They often collaborate with competitors on the common product. Competition and cooperation are two complementary strategies for economic activities in both centralised and decentralised economies. There are a number of criteria that indicate which of the two strategies are more efficient in certain situation. These criteria will be discussed, and then applied to a peer production situation, showing that especially fundamental, non-differentiating products lend themselves towards cooperation.",
    "ï»¿",
    "Open Source foundations are consortia which form to support collaborative development, bridging the divide between companies and volunteer contributors. By applying the criteria for cooperative versus competitive strategies, it will be apparent that cooperating even with competitors in those foundations is a rational approach.",
    "Open Source and standards",
    "Standards play an important role in increasing productivity and competition. While there has been plenty of discussion around the definition of Open Standards, what constitutes such a standard is ambiguous. The requirements of Open Standards to be supportive for Open Source software will be discussed in relation to the definition of Free Software by the FSF, and contrasted to the definitions applied by the International Telecommunication Union, and the European Interoperability Framework.",
    "Standards can only be as open as the licenses of the essential patents that are necessary to implement them. The industry often pushes for the adoption of patented technologies under RAND or FRAND terms. The relation between FRAND terms and Open Standards will be analysed, and compared to the requirements of the Four Freedoms. It will be shown that again, openness applies to the standards themselves, and to the processes in which they are developed.",
    "Open Source has caused a massive standardisation in the use of IT for institutions and individuals. The majority of the Open Source products are never made into formal standards, and usually innovate faster than standard setting organisations can keep up. Depending on the type of Open Source licenses applied, different network effects apply: When copyleft licenses are chosen, there are often converging network effects, leading into the development of a single dominating product like Linux. With permissive licenses, forking of derivative works is more common, as can be observed with the BSD family of operating systems.",
