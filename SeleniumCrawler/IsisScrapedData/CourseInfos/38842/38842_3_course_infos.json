    "We take a\nreflexive approach to the relationship between theory and practice. From here,\nit is particularly important to understand theory as a relevant reference\ndimension of pedagogical action. Theory should help us to better understand and\nactively shape our pedagogical practice. At the same time, theory cannot be\nlearnt statically. Rather, it is also a matter of reflexively working on\ntheory, modifying it if necessary or incorporating further theoretical\nperspectives.",
