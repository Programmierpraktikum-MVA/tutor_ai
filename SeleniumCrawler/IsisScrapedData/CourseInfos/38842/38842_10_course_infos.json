    "By comparing the\napproaches of bell hooks and Paulo Freire, we create a concept for\nteaching-learning settings. Based on our discussion of closeness and distance,\nwe collect in particular framework conditions that are productive for the\ndesign of teaching-learning settings. In doing so, we also look at the aims of\nteaching-learning settings in the context of subject-specific teaching, as well\nas social inequalities that also come into play in the classroom and prompt us\nto reflect on how learning can be made possible regardless of social locations.",
