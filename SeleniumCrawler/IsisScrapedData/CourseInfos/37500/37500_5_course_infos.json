    "[13], which we use as foundational work. However, we identified two areas that can be improved. Firstly, the paper notes that the problem is NP-hard. To mitigate the resulting performance issues, we aim to utilise parallelisation to reduce execution times. Secondly, the algorithms presented in the paper assume a static graph. However, as graphs can evolve over time as new data is inserted, communities too can change. To remedy this, we introduce a novel algorithm to dynamically update the foundational model. We also propose an alteration of our dynamic algorithm that increases performance further at a cost of accuracy. Our experiments show that the parallelisation can reduce execution time by over 50%. Additionally, the results show that the dynamic algorithm increases performance by up to 23% with only a few inserted edges. This performance increase diminishes with a larger number of insertions and falls behind the static algorithm at roughly 120,000 edges. On the other hand, the execution time of the alternate dynamic algorithm is only 2% of its competitors, which goes up to 4% at 120,000 inserted edges with a recorded loss in accuracy of less than 2% on average.",

    "Label propagation algorithm which is utilized for detecting communities in dynamic graphs. LPA suffers from its inherit randomness and the ability to produce low-quality outcomes negatively impacts the accuracy of community detection in complex dynamic graphs. We propose a novel LPA approach that updates the dynamic graph incrementally and incorporates graph theoretical techniques, with a focus on seed selection and graph coloring. The solution involves constructing an oriented graph for the incremental updates and adapting seed nodes detected by the coloring-based seed selection algorithm to boost the accuracy of the initial label assignment. The studies conducted on real graph datasets, such as Facebook and Twitter, demonstrate significant improvements in the quality and consistency of our enhanced Label propagation approach. The enhancements are examined for their effectiveness using quality metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and F1-scores and Modularity. Although our approach has a bigger time complexity due to the OG updates in the pipeline, the base LPA algorithm is outperformed in community detection results and justifies this trade-off. In the conclusion of the thesis potential enhancements such as the parallelization of OG updates and searching for improvements to optimize the adaptation of seed nodes to the LPA algorithm are discussed.",

    "As the amount of data continues to grow rapidly, databases are also getting larger. To ensure high performance when running ad-hoc analysis or applications that utilize these databases, it is crucial to minimize the processing time and processing cost of fetching the data. This is where Materialized Views come in, as they help reduce the query processing time and cost of a query workload. Manually selecting which views to materialize can be a very tedious and time-consuming task, which is why View Selection Algorithms are used to automate this process. There have been numerous proposed approaches to View Selection Algorithms, but they have not undergone a detailed evaluation of important metrics. To make an informed decision about which View Selection Algorithm a database administrator should select for their system, it is necessary to conduct a thorough evaluation of the View Selection Algorithms in terms of various performance metrics and resource constraints. For this reason, we propose a benchmark of View Selection Algorithms, which compares the algorithms by measuring the query processing time, query processing cost, view maintenance cost, and storage cost. We reimplemented two View Selection Algorithms: the Deterministic Multi-View Processing Plan (MVPP) and the Hybrid MVPP, and evaluated their performance using the benchmark. Through this approach, we can make statements on which algorithm is better suited to a specific scenario and how much views selected by View Selection Algorithms can improve the performance. Our assessment indicates that both of the proposed algorithms enhance the performance of the query workload significantly. They reduce query processing time by over 50% and lower query processing costs by over 70%. When comparing both algorithms, our evaluation shows that the hybrid MVPP is better at reducing query processing time and cost. Additionally, both algorithms decrease view maintenance costs by over 70% and reduce storage costs by over 20% when compared to the baseline of materializing all queries in the query workload. In terms of decreasing the view maintenance cost, our experiments show that the deterministic MVPP outperforms the hybrid MVPP, while both algorithms are similar in their storage costs.",
