    ". A major challenge in effectively treating critically ill patients is accurately predicting their mortality risk. In this document, this issue is going to be approached with the Structured State Space Model. A pipeline from Dataset to finished model will be created. The Data will be based on MIMIC-IV and will be transformed through data preparation. The Data is then used to train LSTM and S4 Models in an attempt to predict mortality of patients over a period of time. The evaluation of the metrics show that the S4 model slightly improvemes the accuracy over our LSTM Model.",
