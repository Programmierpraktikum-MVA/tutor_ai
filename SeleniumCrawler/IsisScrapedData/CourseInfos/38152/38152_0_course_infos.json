    "A warm welcome to our course \"Advanced Bioanalytics 2024 (IV, 9 LP)\"!",
    "Knowing the structure of proteins and their complexes can give important insights to the understanding life. This course covers important fields for structure elucidation: electron microscopy (EM), mass spectrometry (MS) and structure modelling (StrucMod).",
    "Each topic will be divided into several subtopics provided by us. Working in small groups on different subtopics you will assemble your knowledge as a whole team into a complete presentation for a world-leading expert of the respective field, to be held on the final day of each topic week.",
    "Peer reviewing your progress and sharing knowledge will optimally set you up for competently and confidently discussing open questions with the field expert.",
    "Along the way, you will strengthen your teamwork, presentation and literature research skills and will learn how to achieve results efficiently in a fixed time frame.",
    "Important for successful completion of the course: punctuality, willingness to learn and work in a team, interest in bioanalytics.",
