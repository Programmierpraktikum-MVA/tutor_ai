    "COURSE\nSTRUCTURE",
    "Some weeks are allocated for class\ndiscussions only, where you actively need to take part and debate the\nreadings/movies assigned for the week. I will be more of a silent observer. In\nother sessions, I will lead the discussions, contextualize the content, and\noffer some theoretical insights. This does not mean you will have to sit down\nand listen to me for hours. But the weight of roles would shift slightly.",
    "You can find the weekly plan below with color\ncodes.",
