    "Some recommendations for the final presentation:",
    "- Aim at 15 minutes per person, in case it gets extended to 20 min.",
    "- Do not try to speak to fast to fit everything in 15 min. It is better to select content. Focus on what is important; \"less is more\".",
    "- Try to follow the structure that we mentioned: put the impressive results or demo first, so that you catch the audience's attention and will keep it till the end.",
    "- To explain the content well, make clear slides: clear layout, right amount of information, nice visualizations, big enough font size.",
    "- Appropriate use of slides: not too many, not too few.",
    "- Rate of speech adequate: not too slow, not too fast.",
    "- Coherent thread: make sure points follow each other logically.",
    "- Conclusion: revisit the main points that you want to convey.",
    "Practice, practice, practice!",
