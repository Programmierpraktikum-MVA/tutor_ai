    "This 2-week\nblock course (26.08.-06.09.2024) on Reproductive Biology and \nReproductive Biotechnologies takes\nplace at the Leibniz-Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in \nFriedrichsfelde\nand combines lectures with hands-on lab training. In the lectures, we \npresent the\nbasics of reproductive biology and endocrinology, as well as current \nreproductive\nbiotechnologies with their application in reproductive medicine, animal\nbreeding, and wildlife conservation. In the lab, you will conduct \nnon-invasive\nhormone monitoring, sperm assessment, and cryopreservation, and get\ndemonstrations of techniques like in vitro fertilization and \nmicromanipulation.\nWe will round out the course with joint discussions on future \nperspectives and legal and ethical aspects of reproductive \nbiotechnologies.",
