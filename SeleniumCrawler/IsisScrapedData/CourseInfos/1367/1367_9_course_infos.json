    "Continuum Mechanics is a branch of physical mechanics that describes the\n macroscopic mechanical behavior of solid or fluid materials considered \nto be continuously distributed. It is fundamental to the fields of \ncivil, mechanical, chemical and bioengineering. This time-tested text \nhas been used for over 35 years to introduce junior and senior-level \nundergraduate engineering students, as well as graduate students, to the\n basic principles of continuum mechanics and their applications to real \nengineering problems. The text begins with a detailed presentation of \nthe coordinate invariant quantity, the tensor, introduced as a linear \ntransformation. This is then followed by the formulation of the \nkinematics of deformation, large as well as very small, the description \nof stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics. As applications \nof these laws, the behaviors of certain material idealizations (models) \nincluding the elastic, viscous and viscoelastic materials, are \npresented."
