    "Professor Howard Barnes provides an overview of thixotropy",
    ", including its description, measurement, and importance across various industries and applications.\n\nDifferent examples of thixotropic systems are given along with a summary of the theories that have been used to describe the phenomenon. \n\nThixotropy is associated with reversible, microstructural and time-dependent changes that come about due to local spatial rearrangement of microstructural components in a structured fluid. This frequently found time-response of a microstructure that is itself changing with time makes thixotropic, viscoelastic behavior one of the greatest challenges facing rheologists today, in terms of its accurate experimental characterization and its adequate theoretical description. \n\nReference:",
