    "Case study collection and debriefing: \"SEA Applications for policies, plans, programs\"",
    "Let's first get a more detailed overview of which policies, plans and programs we can find concrete applications for around the world.",
    "On the one hand, we thus aim to achieve a better understanding of the scope and diversity of SEA applications which is a precondition for discussing appropriate methods for SEAs.",
    "At the same time, we will assign the SEA examples found to the PPP tiers and decision situations, that is, policies (strategies), plans or programs.",
    "The title of the SEA or the corresponding PPP does not always indicate this directly and without a doubt.",
    "Thus, your search strategy may involve steps like:",
    "Search SEA portals/ registries or similar compilations, if applicable",
    "Alternatively or supplementary, conduct a free web search and consider adequate key terms",
    "Aside from case studies in English, feel free to bring up SEA cases in your native language and translate the titles into English",
    "Feel free also to copy a (roughly tag-sized) screenshot of a title page or meaningful figure of the cases next to your (text) title tag on the Miro Board",
    "Search the executive summary and/or introduction of your cases identified to:",
    "Try to specify the PPP tier you consider most attributable and move your tag towards that section",
    "Save and upload the pdf of the cases you found on our Miro Whiteboard (drag & drop).",
    "In comprehensive cases with abundant sub-documents, select at least the executive summaries for the time being",
    "Contribute to the discussion of the SEA applications and tiers and decision-situations as guided by the relevant student moderators in the second part of the class (12 pm - 2 pm).",
