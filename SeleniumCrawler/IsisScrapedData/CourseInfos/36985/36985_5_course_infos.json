    "Still, in SEA practice, it remains challenging to approximate the likely environmental consequences of policies, plans and programs quantitatively. Be it due to the early planning stages, be it due to the lack of relevant algorithms, models etc., at these (for example, landscape or national) scales, be it because only preliminary decisions are to be made or just different pathways or preferred alternatives to be identified, etc.",
    "Now, the question for our research into this arena is: To what degree can you identify quantitative terms and approaches in making SEAs (at all)? And can you find specifically quantification and substantive assessment of cumulative effects? The following items shall guide the task; you can add other aspects you feel are relevant to your analysis.",

    "Where\n becomes SEA (semi-)quantitative, for example, in terms of relevant \nenvironmental objectives to be considered as assessment benchmarks, or as far as \nimpacts of various planning options are concerned, or else? Any quantification of cumulative effects taking place? Provide \nrelevant examples and indicate the SEA cases you found, please.",
    "Have reasonable justifications been provided, in case quantifications have more or less been omitted?",

    "Which big picture of quantification in SEA seems to emerge as far as your case studies reveal?",
    "If applicable, can a set of good practice examples be extracted?",
    "To\n which degree matter the relevant tiers, i.e. does it\nbecome more concrete and quantifiable from (strategic) policies to plans and,\nfinally, more concrete programs?",
    "Any recommendations for future research and development efforts into that arena?",
