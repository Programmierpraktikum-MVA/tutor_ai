    "preliminary meeting by the end of April",
    "to organize this seminar.",
    "The first talk is expected to take place in late May/early June.",
    "Prerequisites:",
    "Analysis I, II, III, Linear Algebra I, II, basic knowledge of PDEs, Functional Analysis.",
    "Description:",
    "The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is a numerical method aims to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the boundary integral equations. Compared to the finite element method, the BEM benefits from the lower dimensional discretization, and also easily deal with (semi-)infinite domains (for example, in scattering problems).",
    "In this seminar, we will focus on the formulation and analysis of the boundary integral equations, as well as the numerical solutions with the BEM, for different PDEs. We will follow the book \"Linear Integral Equations\" (book I) by Rainer Kress (Chapter 6, 9, 12), and \"Integral Equation Methods in Scattering Theory\" (book II) by David Colton and Rainer Kress (Chapter 3, 4). The theoretical details (Chapter 7,8 in the book I) is ignored in this seminar. We propose the following topics:",
    "The Laplacian equation and its fundamental solutions",
    "The definitions and properties of the layer potentials",
    "Uniqueness of solutions of the boundary value problem",
    "Existence of solutions of the boundary value problem",
