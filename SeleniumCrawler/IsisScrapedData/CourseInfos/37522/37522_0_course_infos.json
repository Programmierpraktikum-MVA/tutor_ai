    "The module “Ethics of AI” takes an innovative and experimental \napproach to ethics with an interdisciplinary focus enabled by \ncollaboration between the Computer Science, Engineering Science and \nPhilosophy of Technology departments. It involves engaging with the \ntheoretical and practical approaches that address the intersection of \nethics and technology, in this case AI. You will learn to critically \nassess the relationship between technology and society and to analyze \nthe interactions between technology and society from an ethical \nperspective. Furthermore, you will deal with the deconstruction of the \nconcept of neutrality of technology and learn to critically assess it. \nThe environment will be taken as a stakeholder in its own right in order\n to consider the impact of technological applications from a \nsustainability perspective. The module will provide you with the \nnecessary theoretical foundations stemming from both computer science \n(in particular AI and digital technologies) and ethics. This knowledge \nwill be put into practice and deepened through case-based projects \ncarried out in interdisciplinary groups. The projects will address the \ncurrent challenges encountered through the use of AI technologies in \ndifferent fields of application (e.g. social relationships), as well as \ndiscuss different implementations and possible avenues of research that \ncould enable the development of ethically acceptable AI systems. You and\n your project group will prepare a presentation of your project as well \nas a scientific poster.",
