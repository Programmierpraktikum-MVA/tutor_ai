    "Learning Goals",
    "The course Entrepreneurial Marketing will help participants to understand marketing phenomena in the case of a new startup and in an intrapreneurial setting. We will look at how to market new and innovative products alongside traditional and me too products.",
    "Entrepreneurial Marketing focuses on this special challenge: new marketing methods for new products. Classic core marketing concepts, such as segmentation, positioning, and the marketing mix undergo an \"extreme makeover\" in the context of innovative\n    products hitting the market. The course will mostly use the effectuation theory of entrepreneurship as vehicle to understand the entrepreneurial marketing phenomena. Topics such as effectuation, iterative thinking, principles of affordable loss, adjustment\n    for emerging opportunities, and cooperation with first customers will be discussed in the course. The objective is to have a greater understanding of the entrepreneurial process – a process of opportunity recognition, resource marshalling, and team\n    building driven by communication, creativity and leadership.",
