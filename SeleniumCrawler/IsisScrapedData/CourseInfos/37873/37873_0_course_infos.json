    "The Satellite Communication Project (formerly also called Projekt Amateurfunk) is a cooperation between\n    the Chairs of High-Frequency-Technology and Space Technology at TU\n    Berlin. Students from the international Master of Space Engineering and\n    german bachelor degree programs, primarily Electrical Engineering and\n    Computer Engineering, cooperate in realizing one or multiple projects in\n    the field of satellite communication. Each group or sub-team develops\n    its part of the overall project and will be supported by experienced\n    advisors.",
    "The basic knowledge needed to approach the project will be\n    taught in a few lectures at the beginning of the course. In addition to\n    this, students are required to extend their knowledge independently\n    according to their assigned work package throughout the semester. The\n    groups record their work in form of technical documents, a project\n    report and present their results together in a final presentation.",
    "This semester the Satellite Communication Project will be held in parallel with the entirely new Radio Astronomy Project. Due to the common structure and some common events both projects share this ISIS course.",
