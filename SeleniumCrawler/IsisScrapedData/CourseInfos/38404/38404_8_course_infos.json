    "For those assigned a \"building\" project, a very simple layout is also uploaded in the PIV folder. You only need to select the type of theatre and fill in the corresponding section. For most buildings, existing floor plans, section images, and photographs are sufficient, and redrawing them is unnecessary. Thus, those working on this simpler scheme will receive another five buildings for each of these straightforward case studies to ensure equity with others who analyze the device, context, accessibility, and theatricality, and typically write a descriptive text.",

    "16. **ARCHITECTURE PROJECTS:** That deal with community, gathering, pavilions (something built, no performance).",

    "You will receive the full list this week, but you can start on the initial sheets and raise any questions if needed.",
