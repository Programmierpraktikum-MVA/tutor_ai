    "Dear all,",
    "Just a reminder that this year, the seminar will be presented by the students and not by the supervisors. The tour will take place on Friday around 3:30 PM in Hall 7. Therefore, the shift from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM should be prepared to present the seminar and its content within 15 minutes.",
    "Additionally, I kindly ask you to read through the following points sent to us by the EXPO organizing team for exhibition supervision, so that you are well prepared. Thank you :)",
    "All supervisors are identified by a yellow sticker during their shift, making them easily recognizable to visitors in all cases. (We will distribute the stickers during the first shift, and they should be removed or passed on to the next shift at the end of the shift)",
    "The supervisors are informed about the specific fire and emergency escape routes for their position in the building (see escape plans in the building)",
    "They know the location of the nearest first aid materials",
    "They are informed about the emergency assembly points outside the building (identified by the corresponding green symbols: one in the courtyard and the second in front of the main entrance of the building on the associated square, an example of the symbol is attached)",
    "In the event of an emergency, they help evacuate the building by directing visitors to the correct escape routes",
    "Attached you will find examples of the corresponding signage in the building.",
    "Thank you and have fun at the Expo and with the supervision!",
    "Best regards",
