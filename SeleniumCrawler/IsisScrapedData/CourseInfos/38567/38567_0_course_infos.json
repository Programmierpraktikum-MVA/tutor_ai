    "The seminar is conceived as an intensive course culminating in the international symposium IMPACT THROUGH TEACHING! This event  (24-25 April 2024) aims to illuminate the transformative effects and driving forces of emerging educational practices and to promote a dialogue between students, international researchers and educators in the field of architecture. The seminar will introduce fields of theories, histories and practices of architectural education by engaging students with a critical approach to education and a self-reflection on the own experiences studying architecture.",
