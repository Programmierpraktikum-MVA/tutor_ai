    "Project description",
    "This project gives the opportunity to learn how to conduct research in the Extended Reality domain. Students will be free to identify research directions and develop an XR prototype within different domains provided by the supervisor (e.g., Social XR, XR Gaming, Cloud XR). The project aims to spot a research gap, deliver a functional XR prototype to test hypotheses and run a user study to answer the research questions.",
    "Your tasks in the project are:",
    "- Researching existing state of the art and tools",
    "- Developing/Implementing a basic XR application/solution",
    "- Performing a user testing/experiment",
    "- Analyzing the results from the experiment",
    "Project requirements",
    "- Willingness for international collaboration - speaking in English",
    "- Experience in other VR and/or AR projects is desirable",
    "- Experience with Unity3D and/or OOP is desirable",
    "- Visit of Multimodal Interaction and Usability Engineering is helpful"
