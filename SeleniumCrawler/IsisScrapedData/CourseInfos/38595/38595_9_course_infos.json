    "Project description",
    "The project is offered as a co-operation with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, in the frame of the project SignReality, which aims to create a 3D sign language interpreter displayed in Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. It will serve as an extension of existing user interfaces (e.g., video-conferencing tools or customer support platforms), aiming at better usability and accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing people (DHH). The app will allow users to have in the augmented space a personal interpreter able to translate speech and text. Placing the virtual interpreter next to the speaking person may allow DHH users to have better understanding of the conversation.\n\nThe goal of this semester is to adapt an existing app, developed in Unity, running on Microsoft Hololens 2, onto lightweight AR glasses.\nYour tasks: \nUnderstand existing avatar implementation with the help of the original developers\nLearn the software development kit of XReal AR named “Nebula” \nWrite code to make the avatar compatible with the Nebula SDK \nTest the result on the development Android phone\nWhat can you expect:\nAccess to hardware: a pair of high-tech AR glasses and a development Android phone\nPossibility to publish the results of your work to top-tier conferences",
