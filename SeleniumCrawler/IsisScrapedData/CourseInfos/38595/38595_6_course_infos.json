    "This project will focus on creating a Virtual Reality (VR) Yoga application,\naiming to bring together the latest in technology with the traditional\npractice of yoga. Working together with the Information and\nCommunication Management (ICM) team, our primary task will be\nusability testing. This is to make sure that the app is easy to use,\nenjoyable, and helpful for people who want to practice yoga, regardless\nof their experience level.",
    "During the development stage, we will design a virtual space that feels\npeaceful and suitable for yoga. The app will be user-friendly and offer a\nvariety of yoga exercises and guided meditations that users can do with\njust a VR headset.",
    "The usability testing will be a crucial part of our project. We plan to\ncarefully check how the VR Yoga app works from different angles, such\nas how easy it is to navigate, how engaging the content is, and how\nsatisfied users feel with their overall experience. We will use feedback\nfrom these tests to make the app better, aiming for it to be both useful\nand enjoyable.",
    "Our goal for this project is to create a VR Yoga app that leads the way in\ndigital wellness, offering users a new and immersive way to support\ntheir physical, mental, and emotional health in our digital age.",
