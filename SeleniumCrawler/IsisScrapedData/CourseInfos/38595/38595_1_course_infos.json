    "Hello everyone,",
    "The assignment for the student projects is done. You will find the participant lists in the respective project sections and you have been registered in subgroups in ISIS. This means that you can communicate directly with your project supervisor and the other project members. The next step for you is to take part in the respective project introduction sessions. Please don't forget to register in MOSES/MTS by 26.04.2024.",
    "I wish you all much success with your projects",
