    "Project description",
    "As part of the Chatbot Challenge, you will develop a chatbot that allows user to train how to debate with people thinking in so called echo-bubbles. Furthermore, the bot will help to recognize the usage of different (unfair) argumentation strategies. The bot will use a mid-size Large Language Model (e.g. Mistral 7b) and dynamic prompting to mimic the behavior of discussion partners with extreme opinions (e.g. negation of climate change).",
    "Each team has of 4 to 5 students and must decide to work in either English or German.",
    "The challenge is organized in cooperation with the Department for Mobile Dialog Systems of Otto von Guericke Universität Magdeburg as a parallel event and with additional supervision of colleagues from DFKI Berlin. Throughout the project, the results will be continuously evaluated through joint user studies, providing valuable insights in user experience analysis.",
    "This module offers you the opportunity to deepen your skills in the design, implementation, and evaluation of software applications, particularly in conversational interfaces.",
    "You will learn to apply technologies such as Large Language Models, prompting and Python as well as how to evaluate conversational human-machine systems. Additionally, you will independently plan and execute a complex project.",
    "We are excited to see your creative ideas and wish you success in the Chatbot Challenge!",
    "You should bring some of the following interests:",
    "- Chatbots and Natural Language Processing",
    "- User Experience and User Research",
    "- Software development and programming",
    "- Design thinking and agile methods",
    "- Strengthen democracy and constructive debate",
