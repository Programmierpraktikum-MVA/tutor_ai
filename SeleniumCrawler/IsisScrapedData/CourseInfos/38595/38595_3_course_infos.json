    "Project description",
    "This project will focus on modeling the disinformation detection process from a computational perspective. The participants will explore approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disinformation detection mechanisms. This involves understanding existing (manual) processes, identifying gaps or areas for improvement through ML/NLP, and leveraging a variety of tools (e.g. search engines, news aggregators, etc.) to address these challenges.\n\nThe goal is to develop a reproducible processing and classification pipeline that performs well on a disinformation detection benchmark. The participants will work in pairs of two to implement their approach.",
    "Your tasks in the project are:",
    "- Conduct a review of disinformation detection processes",
    "- Identify strengths and weaknesses in existing detection approaches",
    "- Propose novel features or functionalities for improvement",
    "- Develop a reproducible end-to-end pipeline",
    "- Evaluate the pipeline on a disinformation detection benchmark dataset",
    "- Prepare a scientific report and the final presentation",
    "Project requirements",
    "- Experience in implementing reproducible end-to-end ML applications.",
    "- Intermediate knowledge in Python.",
    "- Intermediate knowledge in NLP & Software Engineering\nWillingness to learn about the disinformation detection process.",
    "- Willingness to compete in groups on a presented benchmark task"
