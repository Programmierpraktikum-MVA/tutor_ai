    "Project description",
    "The International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) is a worldwide association of researchers in the field of speech communication. As a non-commercial association, it organizes conferences and workshops, and also provides scholarships for student participants. Two portals are now to be created for a new ISCA website, with the help of which workshops can be proposed and reviewed on the one hand, and students and other researchers can apply for scholarships for ISCA events on the other. In both cases, a web-based database with various front-ends, probably using budibase, needs to be set up. These should be based on the requirements of future users, so that a user-centered design process is necessary. A connection to the existing website (under WildApricot) must also be made in order to use the user management there, for example. Finally, the solutions created are to be tested under various conditions.",
