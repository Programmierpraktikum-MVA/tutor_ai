    "The commonly used electrical plug and socket \"Schuko=Schutzkontakt\" Type-F in Germany has two",
    "horizontal pins in the plug and symmetric upper and lower clamps in the socket with counter electrodes",
    "for the earth connection. This way the earth connection is redundant but you can rotate the plug and",
    "swap neutral and phase.",
    "Similarly the Italian Type-L is symmetric with three horizontal pins in",
    "the plug. In contrast, the American Type-1 connector is even without earth connector asymmetric.",
    "A French connector Type-E has the same dimensions but instead of the clamps a third pin in the middle",
    "above neutral and phase in the socket. This way it is asymmetric and you cannot swap phase and",
    "neutral.",
    "However it has never been regulated which pin in the plug is phase and which neutral such",
    "that you cannot benefit from the uniqueness.",
    "Can you guess why the norm did not assign the phase to a specific pin because this seems to be a Poka-Yoke inspired design?",
    "Hint: think how electric wiring is installed"
