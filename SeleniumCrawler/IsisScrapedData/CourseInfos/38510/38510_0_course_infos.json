    "The seminar will \nprovide an international perspective on ethnic segregation, also in its \nclose relation to social segregation. Drivers of ethnic segregation and \nthe interplay between the preferences and resources of migrant \npopulations and the (enabling or constraining) conditions of the housing\n market will be discussed. We will focus on the impact of segregation on\n the participation of newcomers, their upward social mobility, and also \non issues of social cohesion and local forms of solidarity.",
    "Both a\n Berlin neighbourhood (Rollbergsiedlung) and international case studies \nwill be used to shed light on local governance constellations, \ndiscourses and planning approaches. Discussions will encourage critical \nthinking and analysis of planning's role in addressing sociospatial \ninequalities. In their presentations and a final paper, students can \nchoose an international case study to explore different facets of \n(spatial) inclusion and exclusion and planning approaches.",
