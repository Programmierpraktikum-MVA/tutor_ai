    "The pharmaceutical\nindustry relies heavily on antigen development to produce effective vaccines,\ndiagnostics, and therapeutics. Utilizing high-throughput platforms equipped\nwith miniaturized bioreactors offers an efficient approach to test process\nconditions and growth parameters. Integration of liquid handling stations,\ncultivation systems, and analytics, along with the utilization of Python\nscripts and software, creates a comprehensive control unit.  Throughout the cultivation process, at-line\nand online measurements provide valuable insights, while offline product\nanalytics contribute to the final step of modeling the bioprocess and\ndetermining the production yield. Modeling the process involves considering\nvarious factors such as substrate, temperature, and product formation, enriching\nthe foundation for thorough research outcomes and refined production\nstrategies",
