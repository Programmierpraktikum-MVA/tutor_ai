    "The BVT specializes on\nhard-to-express proteins and has developed different strategies to that end.\nFor example, medium composition and cultivation strategy are important factors\nfor successful enzyme expression. Obtaining Enzymes/biocatalysts in active form\nand high yields is key to a transformation of the chemical industry towards a\nmore sustainable form of production. For this project, 10 different truncations\nof the human adenylate kinase 9 have been cloned in 10 different vectors (25\nconstructs), which need to be tested for expression and best expression\nstrategy (batch vs fed-batch) in",
