    "Formate can be efficiently produced by\nelectrochemical or photochemical catalytic conversion of CO2 and can be used\ndirectly by microorganisms as an organic carbon source. This means that it\noffers the possibility of converting and storing renewable energy, which can\nthen be used for the cultivation of microorganisms. To improve the ability of\nmicroorganisms to utilize formate, adaptive laboratory evolution can be used to\ntransform strains to grow on formate as their sole carbon source. To understand\nchanges in the metabolism of microorganisms, it is crucial to characterize the\nparent strain, which is the focus of this course. Students will also gain\ninsights into the power of adaptive laboratory evolution in the open-source\nrobotic platform for experimental automation in bioscience research and education,\nChi.Bio.",
