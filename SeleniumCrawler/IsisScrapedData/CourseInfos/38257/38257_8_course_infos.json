    "Nucleoside antibiotics form a diverse group of\nsecondary metabolites of microbial origin. They include a variety of structural\nmodifications of nucleosides and nucleotides, often leading to intricate\nmolecules. In addition to C-nucleosides or peptidyl nucleosides, halogenated\nnucleosides have also been described. Enzymatic halogenation is a rapidly\ndeveloping tool in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. Operating at ambient\ntemperatures in aqueous media, halogenating enzymes allow halogen atoms' regio-\nand stereoselective installation. Apart from modulating the physicochemical\nproperties of molecules and, in consequence, their biological activity, halogen\natoms can also serve as chemical linchpins for further derivatization of the\nmolecular scaffold, for example, in chemo-enzymatic cascades. Diverse\nhalogenases have been described so far, however, hardly any halogenases that\nuse nucleosides as substrate are well characterized.",
    "Therefore, in this practical course, we will\ncharacterize a previously identified nucleoside halogenase by determining\noptimal working conditions (e.g., temperature, pH) or challenge the enzyme with\nvarious modified substrates (Workpackage 1). If the biocatalyst is unavailable\nthen, we will focus on expressing and purifying the enzyme (Workpackage 2).",
