    "From idea to business plan!",
    "In the second module, the MC SIC\ntakes a hands-on approach, as interdisciplinary student groups select one of\nthe innovative ideas conceived during the Design Thinking phase and embark on a\ntransformative journey. They will develop their chosen idea from scratch into a\ncomprehensive Business Plan, honing their project management, financial, and\nstrategic skills along the way. This module encourages students to apply their\nknowledge and expertise to create sustainable and inclusive construction solutions\nthat are not only innovative but also viable in the market.",
    "Prior to attending in-person classes,\nparticipants will have access to instructive video content that covers the\ntheoretical foundations of each module. These videos serve as a preparatory\nresource, enabling students to familiarize themselves with essential concepts\nand principles at their own pace. During the scheduled in-person class hours,\nour focus shifts to interactive engagement. This time is dedicated to\naddressing questions, fostering discussions, and applying the acquired\nknowledge in practical scenarios.",
