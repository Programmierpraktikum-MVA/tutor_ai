    "Overview",
    "From a fundamental Physics perspective: Students will learn about the basic physical processes involved in Hydrogen Storage and production/extraction. In particular, Students will learn about electrolyte dynamics, and colloidal suspensions and aggregation. These systems are governed by bubble formation, hence students will be introduced to standard nucleation theory. At the same time, in order to capture the transport phenomena, students will be introduced to the basics of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and linear response theory.",
    "From an applied perspective: students will attain an overview about the processes involved in hydrogen production/extraction. In particular, students will be introduced to the different working principles (AEM and PEM) as well as to the dynamics of LOHC carrying/discharging (see this video",
