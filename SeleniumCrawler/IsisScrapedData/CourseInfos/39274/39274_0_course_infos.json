    "Passive depth analysis using stereo image\n        processing is applied in a large variety of domains such as media\n        production, robotic, quality control, and production, medical, security\n        and remote sensing. New visualization techniques, like Virtual and\n        Augmented Reality offer completely new application scenarios. In this\n        course, the fundamentals of projective geometry is taught and and the\n        geometric relationship between two camera views is presented. In this\n        context, the estimation of camera parameters and the correspondence\n        analysis in stereo images and videos will be discussed. The practical\n        use of stereo image processing is illustrated by current research\n        projects at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.",
    "The lecture is given in English. The exam will be performed as written exam at the end of the semester.",
