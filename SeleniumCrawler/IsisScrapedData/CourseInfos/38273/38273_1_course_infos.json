    "Each week you will get new material in the form of videos and text. In combination, the videos and text material replace the contents of the classical lecture.",
    "Here is an overview of topics and chapters covered in this course:",
    "Chapter 1: Multimedia and Multimodality",
    "Chapter 2: Hearing and Speech",
    "Chapter 3: Vision",
    "Chapter 4: Other Senses, Integration and Cognition",

    "Grading",
    "Tests will be covering the whole content of the course and will last 90 minutes. The first test will be about the very basics of human perception/interaction in relation to multimodal systems. The second test be about the technical side of multimodal systems.",
    "Each written test will account for 30% of the final grade, meaning 60% total",
    ".",
    "Additionally, to tests, there is going to be homework and project work. For this part of the course, you will be a group and have to work together with other students. Homeworks are going to question your theoretical understanding of some chapters, while the aim of the project work is to cover concepts presented in the course through practice. T",

The goal of this task is to get you more familiar with the concepts, presented in the course. We recommend that you have some background in programming, but you don't need to be a professional programmer.",
    "The project is divided into several subtasks that you should complete in the respective week. However, during the whole project, you are creating one game and one solution that has to be submitted. Furthermore, you will be asked to shorty present your game (in a form of a video).",
