    "Groups are going to be used in the course for project work and homework. Idea is that you work together as a group and submit one solution for each homework and project. Grading is going to be done per solution, and all members of the same group will receive the same points for it. Each group can have a maximum of four students.",
    "You are encouraged to talk to other students and form groups by yourself as soon as possible. However, the possibility to select a group in ISIS will open only after the registration deadline is over to ensure that only enrolled students are taking place in groups. The deadline for selecting a group is five days before the deadline of the first homework, as you are supposed to submit your first homework in groups already.",
