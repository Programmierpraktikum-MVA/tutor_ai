    "a. Interaction in the Course",
    "Like\n all courses at Faculty VII, this module is also under the credo \"no \ndiscrimination\", instead \"tolerance\" with and for all. Therefore, we \nemphasize the following principles in our interactions with each other:",
    "We\n maintain a consistently respectful interaction with each other (see \ndiversity strategy) and prefer to use inclusive language (see guidelines\n for gender-sensitive language in german).",
    "We show consideration for different levels of knowledge, experience and points of view.",
    "We reflect on our own (speech) behavior and avoid reproducing violent terms, expressions or content.",
    "We\n respect the voluntary indication of desired pronouns and \nself-definitions as far as it is not an obvious abuse of a marginalized \nidentity and group.",
    "When possible, we use the camera in online courses to better and respectfully communicate with each other.",
    "However,\n should tensions, conflicts or even violations of the principles arise, \nthe following approaches  can help to resolve the situation:",
    "Communication with each other: Difficulties can be addressed respectfully after the event/  in (private) chat.",
    "Communication\n with instructors: Instructors are always available for you to talk to. \nAfter the event/ via e-mail/ in a consultation hour the teachers can be \ninformed and problems can be solved",
    "b. Contact points",
    "If\n difficulties cannot be solved within the course, there are other \ncontact points available at TU. These can offer support, counseling, or \nmediation. In the specific case of sexual discrimination or questions \nabout equality issues, you can always contact the women and gender \nequality officer of  Faculty VII, the contact details can be found here.\n Here you will find other important addresses that offer assistance. A \nselection of contact persons are for example the Academic Advising \nService, the Student Counseling / GKWI, the Psychological Counseling, \nthe Family Services Office and the Counseling Service for Students",
