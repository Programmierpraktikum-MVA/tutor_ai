    "This collaborative design studio will focus on the physical linkages \nbetween energy, mobility, waste management and buildings in different \ngeographic settings in Africa and Latin America. The design concepts \nwill consider policy and finance aspects and apply co-development \napproaches. Cross-sectoral, gender-sensitive living labs  act as \nblueprints for local implementation actions in the selected partner \ncountries and beyond. Studio participants will have the opportunity to \nexchange with decision-makers, technical staff and entrepreneurs in the \nco-design process.",
    "This studio supports on-going research and implementation projects \nthrough  improving synergies between key sectors and fostering local \ninnovation in transformative living labs with the aim to contribute to \nsustainable urban development.",
    "The PIV linked to the studio is realized in cooperation with \nUN-Habitat, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Wuppertal \nInstitute and local project partners.",

    "Through a set of collaborative methods and tools for mapping and \ndesign the studio proposes  to develop a critical understanding of the \nrole of architects and urbanists, especially in contexts of marginalized\n spaces and communities.",
    "The studio intends to promote a transdisciplinary debate by focusing \non the perceptions of inclusion of refugees in Berlin, and by \ncollaborating closely with local actors and institutions. Thus, it \nencourages students to reflect on the integrative and co-productive role\n of city-building professionals and to devise  scenarios that aim to \ntransform the current situation.",
    "The discussions will address issues \nof spatial conflicts and negotiation, insurgent planning and design, the\n right to the city, housing vs. shelter from the perspective of \ninstitutional barriers, architectural and infrastructural elements and social-spatial dynamics.",
    "In close collaboration withe the Senate’s integration program “BENN” \nin Marzahn, students will have the opportunity to engage with local \nactors and the community, develop activities and interventions and \nestablish a dialog with refugees living in Berlin shelters.",
    "The studio is a cooperation of the research project „Beyond the \nShelter: Limits and Possibilities between Departure and Endurance in \nRefugee Shelters in Berlin“ (DFG) with Juliana Canedo, the project \n„Architectures of Asylum“ (SFB: 1265 Re-figurations of Space“, DFG) with\n Qusay Amer and Francesca Ceola, as well as Maureen Abi-Ghanem and Saba \nBarani. The Studio will be developed in cooperation with the Seminar \nContemporary Arab Urbanism and joint activities will be planned.",
    "A PIV connected to the Studio will deal with broader theoretical \nquestions related to migration and refugee studies; it will be conducted\n as a lecture series in cooperation with “Architectures of Asylum”.",

    "Society and nature have too often been understood as separate - an \nasymmetrical and uneven arrangement of power between human and non-human\n realms. In the age of climate breakdown, technological fixes dominate \nand are regarded as the remedy to saving our rapidly crumbling planet.",
    "In contrast, queer ecology is a growing transdisciplinary approach \nthat challenges heteronormative, anthropocentric views on the (natural) \nworld and seeks to transcend socially constructed binaries such as \nculture vs. nature, civilized vs. untamed, pristine vs. contaminated, \nurban vs. rural, male vs. female. Queer ecology acknowledges the \nfluidity and diversity of identities within human and other-than-human \nspheres. It celebrates the unusual, the odd, and the messy realities of \ncohabitation. It dismantles systems of oppression and shifts the \nmarginal to the center. Its goal is to cultivate inclusive relationships\n with the environment and all living beings, honoring the widest spectra\n and the pluriverse, rather than limiting them.",
    "In this research-driven and explorative studio, we will collectively \napproach queer ecologies and spectral urban natures from multiple \nangles. We will analyze ecofeminist utopias and practices of care for \nthe earth; we will learn from indigenous knowledge and bicultural \ndiversity; we will garner knowledge from queer adaptation and community \npractices. In a collective effort and equipped with insights from case \nstudies and transdisciplinary readings, we will develop strategies and \nformats for an alternative urban practice rooted in a queer ecology \napproach.",
    "The studio is accompanied by inputs, field trips, lectures, film \nscreenings, and workshops and will mainly take place at Floating",
    "University",
    ".\n Students should come with an open mind and bring enthusiasm for the \ntopic, motivation for peer learning, independent critical thinking, and \nthe readiness to freely develop projects of urban practice in small \ngroups and as a collective.",
