    "uses a finite element method to simulate 2D fluid flows and heat transfer problems.",
    "Simply draw on the screen to add objects into the flow domain, and the built-in mesh generator will automatically generate a triangle mesh for the solver. Then select the type of problem you want to solve, potential flow or heat transfer, and hit 'Solve' to compute and visualize the solution.",
    "The app also allows you to change the mesh resolution, and offers options for visualizing the solution and its gradient using a variety of different color schemes. meshFlow can generate streamlines and animate particles in the flow, and also offers an \"interactive flow\" mode where you can manually add particles to any location in the flow."
