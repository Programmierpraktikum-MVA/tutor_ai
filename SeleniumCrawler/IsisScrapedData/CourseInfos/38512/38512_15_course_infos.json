    "According to the discussion from last meeting I would like to give some guidelines for the final presentations.",
    "The total duration of your presentation depends on the number of group members. Please make sure that each person of your goup has an active part of 5 to 10 minutes. The arrangement of contributions of each person within a group is fully flexible.",
    "Please make use of the opportunities of the BOL in presenting sounds and visual information. Even the level of your recordings can be adjusted to the original one so that we can re-experience your investigated site.",
    "Your structure of your presentation could be as follows: Introduction/Motivation/Goals, Current Status, Design approaches, Conclusions/Outlook/Recommendations. It would be great if you could derive some recommendations at the end of your presentation. Of course, you can deviate from the proposed structure if you prefer to use an alternative structure.",

    "Final report - Poster format possible",
    "According to the discussion from last meeting we would like to mention that the final written report to be submitted at the end of September as part of the portfolio exam, could be replaced by a development of a poster. This alternative report format is even highly recommended as it might excellently illustrate your work and ideas. If a poster is prepared it will be displayed in the Department of Engineering Acoustics and will serve as a guidance for future students in the EARS course and maybe can be presented on the website as well.",
    "If you have questions or remarks, please do not hesitate to contact us.",
