    "The\n study of science itself using the tools of the scientific method is \nknown as ‘Metascience’. Its goal is to enhance scientific credibility \nwhile fostering integrity and transparency by uncovering the underlying \nmechanisms shaping science today. It arose as a field of study due to \nconcerns about reproducibility analysis, publication biases, peer-review\n systems, lack of replication studies, and misconduct within the \nscientific communities.",
    "In the seminar, the students will use empirical metascientific studies to ask fundamental and controversial questions like:",
    "What is a good measure of scientific progress for scientists, institutions, and society?",
    "What is the role of open access? Shouldn’t all of science be open-access? What is the cost of open-access publishing?",
    "What are predatory journals? What makes them predatory? Who is the prey? Why do they exist?",
    "Below, you can find a few resources to get started:",
