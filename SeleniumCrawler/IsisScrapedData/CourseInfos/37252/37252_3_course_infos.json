    "The\n human mind, with its inherent biases, can be a significant obstacle in \nthe scientific quest for objective truth. Well-documented fallacies like\n cherry-picking data and confirmation bias can subtly or overtly \ninfluence research outcomes. Researchers might unconsciously favor \nevidence that aligns with their expectations or selectively present data\n that confirms their initial hypothesis. These cognitive pitfalls \nthreaten the integrity of scientific practices. To ensure unbiased \nresults, researchers must be mindful of these psychological tendencies \nand actively mitigate them. Only through such vigilance can we be \nconfident in the pursuit of undistorted knowledge.",
    "In\n this section, students will be introduced to the most common cognitive \nbiases and fallacies, and their impact on research. We will also explore\n robust scientific methods for conductingÂ clear and unbiased research.",
