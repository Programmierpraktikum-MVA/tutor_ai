    "What is science? And why don’t we teach you about it directly? Well, here we will try to! What should you think of the explosive scientific progress in robotics and AI? What do these questions have to do with each other? Well, let’s find out together!",
    "The subject of this seminar are the recent and past advancements in robotics and AI. We are going to discuss, analyze, and evaluate these advancements. How significant are those advancements? What defines progress in robotics? How can we assess the amount of progress made by a particular contribution? Is deep learning all we need? Can we repeat the success of deep learning in NLP and computer vision in robotics? If not: How come? To address these questions, we will need to discuss the scientific method and related principles of good scientific practice, academic honesty, experimental design and interpretation, reasoning with uncertain information, and dealing with ambiguous observations.",
    "In our analysis of scientific progress, we want to be as scientific as possible. You have taken many courses that teach you the output of science - but only rarely do you explicitly learn what the “scientific method” really is (spoiler: it is not really one fixed thing). You will learn why it is necessary to compensate for humans’ cognitive limitations, and why the scientific method (in addition to science itself)  is becoming increasingly important for our society as a whole, especially in times of generative AI, fake news and populism.",
    "Initially, we will have four sessions focusing on the principles of science,  good scientific practice and common human psychological tendencies that can sometimes hinder adherence to these practices. With this understanding, we will examine the scientific soundness of various fields of robotics through presentation and discussion sessions.",
