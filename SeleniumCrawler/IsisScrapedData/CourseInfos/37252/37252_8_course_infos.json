    "The\n industrial robotics sector is currently witnessing significant \ntransformations characterized by two major developments. Firstly, \nprominent corporations such as Google, Toyota (Toyota Research \nInstitute), Nvidia, Meta, and Hyundai (Boston Dynamics) are investing in\n their robotics research departments, attracting a substantial portion \nof academic research talent. Secondly, there is a surge in investments \nwithin the domain of humanoid robotics, with a notable increase of \ncompanies dedicated to building humanoid platforms over the past 3-4 \nyears. These companies share the vision that current advancements in AI,\n including technologies such as ChatGPT, will enhance robot \ncapabilities,Â  thereby addressing longstanding obstacles to commercial \nrobot adoption.",
    "In\n this section, students will explore these developments and their \nimplications through presentations and discussions around one \nor multiple of the following or related questions:",
    "Is industrial research detrimentally impacting academia and thereby slowing down progress in robotics?",
    "Is the amount of investment proportional to research outcomes? What drives industrial robotics research incentives?",
    "Are humanoid robots the robotic market of the future? And, is the associated hype justified?",
    "Will Nvidia emerge as the leading robotics company in the next decade?",
