    "The\n usage of simulation has long been a contentious topic in the robotics \ncommunity. In the resources section, you can find arguments from its \nproponents and detractors. It is fair to say that the answers to the \nsimulation question will be nuanced and specific. This is reflected in \nthis course, where the student will examine the role of simulation in a \nspecific context. Here, we present three examples as starting points. \nStudents are encouraged to formulate their own questions or hypotheses:",

    ":\n In robot learning, robots trained in simulation usually do not work in \nreality. The sim2real transfer problem was born to bridge this gap and \nhas now become its own sub-field. However, is it a good idea to \ndecompose the problem of robot learning into simulation, simulated \ntraining, and sim2real transfer?",

    ":\n Simulation technology is the nexus of numerous scientific disciplines, \ne.g., computer graphics, mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, \ncomputational physics, etc. What key problems in simulation technology \ncan the broader scientific community realistically address that would \ngreatly benefit robotics?",

    ":\n Simulation is an integral part of the robotics infrastructure. Anyone \nwith a laptop can program a simulated million-dollar humanoid robot in \nROS Gazebo; or install gym environments and train simulated robots using\n only a few commands. However, if the research can only be conducted \nwith real robots, does that mean robotic research will be less \naccessible? and how should we remedy that?",
