    "This\n section of the course focuses on the impact of large-scale research \nprojects on robotics science. By large-scale we mean research endeavors \nthat go beyond what would be possible in a single academic research lab.\n We are particularly interested in the lessons-learned from such \nlarge-scale projects with respect to technical solutions to robotics \nproblems, but also the organization of research in the wider societal \ncontext. Students are welcome to look at large-scale research projects \nin robotics, but also study different fields of science such as CERN for\n basic science in physics.",
    "There are three areas that might be particularly interesting",
    ".\n First, students could delve into the technical lessons learned from \nprojects run by large corporations or large academic collaborations. \nSecond, the implications of military funding and collaborations in \nrobotics research could be discussed. Lastly, the successes and \nchallenges in large-scale academic alliances in robotics and other \nfields can be investigated.",
    "Below\n we provide entry points into the literature along with some questions \nthat can get you started with thinking about these concerns, but \nconsider these only as some pointers - please fan out widely and explore\n more resources and questions yourself.",

    "Questions",
    "What\n is the most promising way to build an autonomous system? To answer this\n question, the students will begin by researching several large-scale \nprojects and their publications and classify them based on development \nconcepts such as general-purpose vs. domain-specific, end-to-end \nlearning vs. model-based, LLMs vs. ontology, etc. Which directions look \nmore promising for building a reliable autonomous system?",
    "What\n are the implications of a few companies that can afford to run \nlarge-scale robotics experiments? Can the release of open-source \ndatasets by large corporations bias follow-up research?",
    "Lessons from military programs for (robotics) science:",

    "Classified military projects: e.g.",
    "Manhattan Project",
    "Questions",
    "To\n what extent should research funded by the military be transparent and \nsubject to public and scientific scrutiny? Given the secretive nature of\n military projects, there's a challenge in balancing national security \ninterests with the public's right to know and the academic community's \nprinciples of openness and transparency.",
    "Which\n technologies have made it from invention in the military context into \ncommercial (robotic) products and how? (e.g. Radar, GPS, iHY Hand to \nRightHand Robotics)",
    "What\n are the broader social and economic implications of military-funded \nrobotics research? For instance, could the focus on military \napplications divert resources and attention from using robotics to \naddress critical civilian challenges like healthcare, disaster response,\n or environmental protection?",
