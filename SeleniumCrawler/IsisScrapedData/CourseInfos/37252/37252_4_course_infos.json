    "The\n line between reality and fiction has become increasingly blurred, \nchallenging viewers to discern fact from fabrication. Videos and stories\n of robots with human-like behaviors have been around long before \nbreakthroughs in AI. However, they were the results of imagination, CGI \ntechnology and often featured in animation, movies or fiction. In these \ncontexts, most viewers and readers would assume those behaviors as \nunreal. Nowadays, across different social media platforms, we can find \nvideos, articles of real robots with phenomenal capabilities, e.g., \ncooking, folding T-shirt, dancing. These robots effortlessly and \ngracefully perform intricate tasks as a human.",
    "While\n undoubtedly many of these videos and articles showcase genuine \nengineering feats, there remains a lingering uncertainty about the \nextent to which they accurately represent the capabilities of these \nrobots. They captivate audiences with the promise of a close future \nwhere robots seamlessly integrate into our daily lives.",
    "In\n this section, students will examine such videos and articles and their \nimplications through presentations and discussions centered around one \nor multiple of the following questions:",
    "Are current robots as smart and as capable as humans already?",
    "Do researchers, scientists intentionally create videos and articles like these?",
    "Would these be considered as deception, bad scientific practices?",
    "How\n would these videos and articles be perceived by others (researchers, \nengineers, students, the general public)? How would their perception, \nfeeling be affected?",
