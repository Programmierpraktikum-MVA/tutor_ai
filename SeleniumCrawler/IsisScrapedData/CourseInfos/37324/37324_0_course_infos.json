    "This course is a sequel to Algorithmic and Discrete Mathematics I (ADM I). The aim is to introduce more advanced concepts of linear and integer programming and applications in combinatorial optimization, as well as further well-known problems in combinatorial optimization. Knowledge from ADM I (in particular linear programming, polyhedra, duality) is essential to following the course.",
