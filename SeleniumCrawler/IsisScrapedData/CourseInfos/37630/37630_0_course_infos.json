    "In this project, several topics related to networking will be introduced in two to three introductory seminars. These topics include SDNs, payment-channel networks, multicast, internet measurements, security and the use of AI in networking. Based on these topics, students will be offered complex, implementation based projects which they will complete in groups over the course of the remainder of the semester. Students may also propose their own projects as long as they fit within the topics of the course. Each group will work self organized and will be assigned an advisor with which they will meet on a regular basis. The groups will present their progress to the other",
