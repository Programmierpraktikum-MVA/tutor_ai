    "This course offers a comprehensive exploration into the intersection of\nartificial intelligence, machine learning, and musical creativity. Over the\ncourse of 13 in-depth sessions, students will engage with a variety of topics\nthat illuminate the roles AI and machine learning currently play and are poised\nto play in the future of music and sound. This course aims to equip students\nwith a robust understanding of contemporary AI tools, their assemblages and\ntheir applications in music production, while simultaneously fostering critical\nthinking about the broader implications of these technologies.",
    "The sessions are designed to sequentially\nunfold the historical narrative of AI in music, engage with current\nphilosophical discourses on technology and art, and provide practical\nexperiences with state-of-the-art AI tools. Beginning with the nascent stages\nof algorithmic composition and traversing through to contemporary breakthroughs\nin neural synthesis and text-to-audio, attendees will gain firsthand insights\ninto AI's transformative impact on the musical domain.",

    "Special attention is devoted to the idiosyncratic nature of AI tools,\nunderscoring their ability to develop personalized user models and highlighting\ntheir capacity to traverse and reinterpret musical territories. These tools,\ncapable of being trained on specific datasets, deftly navigate the latent\nspaces of musical materiality, offering a tailored and distinctive approach to\nmusical materials. The course\ncultivates a transconstructive sensibility and inferentialist intuition,\nencouraging a willingness to engage with AI not solely in a constructive manner\nbut also with an openness to adversarial musicking and the unconventional.",
    "Interactivity is a cornerstone of this course,\npromoting active dialogue, reflection, and experiential learning. Participants\nwill not only theoretically dissect AI in music but will also operationalize\ntheir knowledge through practical exercises, culminating in individual research\ninitiatives and dynamic in-class presentations.",
    "Upon completion, participants will have developed both the knowledge to\ncritically assess AI tools in music and the practical experience to apply these\ntechnologies creatively.",
    "Participants\nwill depart with the conceptual acuity to\ncreatively apply AI tools in music, and they will be inspired to think\nindependently and critically about the evolving landscape of technology in art.",
