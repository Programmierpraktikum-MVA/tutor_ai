We\n    will discuss Sobolev spaces, which rely\n    on a generalized notion of differentiability, variational problems\n    and the associated operator equations, monotone operators, Galerkin\n    methods and linear finite elements as well as the Lax-Milgram lemma and\n    the theorem of Zarantonello.",
