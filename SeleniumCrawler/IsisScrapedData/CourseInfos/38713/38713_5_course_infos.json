    "Intended for graduate students, this seminar will introduce the tools of\n membrane protein synthesis and their functional characterization. \nMembrane proteins account for more than 30% of the genome in living \norganisms and many membrane-embedded receptors, transporters and ion \nchannels are important therapeutic targets. In this context, \nmethodologies concerning the functional characterization, the structure \nand the biochemical properties of membrane proteins, their regulation \nand their physiological relevance are in the focus of this seminar. \nEmphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, \nincluding systems for the in vivo and in vitro expression of membrane \nproteins. The seminar gives a detailed introduction on problems \nconcerning the interaction of chemical messengers with specific \ncell-surface receptors, the activation of signal-transduction cascades \nleading to the accumulation of specific intracellular second messenger \nmolecules and the cell’s response to an external stimulus. Beside others\n the following topics are discussed in detail: Ligand-gated ion channels\n and their signaling between electrically excitable cells; G \nprotein-coupled receptors, triggering downstream signal transduction \ncascades, thereby activating separate membrane-associated enzymes and \ncatalytic receptors, acting as enzymes themselves. A critical approach \nto lipid-membrane protein interactions and the pharmacological \nproperties of selected membrane proteins is also in the focus of this \nseminar.",
