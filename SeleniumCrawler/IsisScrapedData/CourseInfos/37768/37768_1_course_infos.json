    "In this first session we will discuss the philosophy of mathematics in general. First: the traditional questions that have occupied philosophers of mathematics since antiquity, e.g.,",
    "metaphysical ones (what are mathematical objects? what is mathematics about? what is mathematical truth? what is infinity?),",
    "epistemological ones (how can we know mathematical truths? is mathematical knowledge necessary and a priori? what is the importance of proofs in mathematics?),",
    "foundational ones (does mathematics need logical foundations? what are they? how do they work?).",
    "Next, I will introduce some questions about mathematics that modern philosophers of maths are interested in, e.g.,",
    "What is the philosophical significance of mathematicians' practices?",
    "What are the ethical dimensions of maths?",
    "How do mathematical concepts change and grow?",
    "What is the status of probabilistic proofs, computer proofs, and massively collaborative proofs?",
    "Why is mathematics so useful?",
    "There is some flexibility in the course content, so we will use this first session to agree on some topics to be covered.",

    "Last year I created a blueprint for the \"Diversity Reading List\" on the topic \"People and Proof\". The aim is to set out a course of reading on philosophy of mathematics that would not normally be covered in a standard course, and to celebrate a more diverse selection of authors. Given the flexibility of the course, we could certainly cover some of the topics from this list in our seminar."
