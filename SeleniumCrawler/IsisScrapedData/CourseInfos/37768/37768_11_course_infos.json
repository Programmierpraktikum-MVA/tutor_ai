    "In this session we will look at the role of computers in modern mathematics. For example, the four colour theorem was famously proved using a computer to do a large case-enumeration. Was this still a proof in the traditional sense? Furthermore, there is a lot of excitement about the use of AI to do mathematics. We will discuss the philosophical questions that might arise because of this.",
