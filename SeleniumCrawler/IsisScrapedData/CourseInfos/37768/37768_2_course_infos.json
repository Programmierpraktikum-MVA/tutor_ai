    "In this section we will discuss mathematical objects, whether or not they exist (and what that might mean), and whether they are invented or discovered.",
    "We will start with Plato's theory of the forms, then look at modern forms of platonism such asMark Balaguer's full-bodied platonism.",
    "Next we will talk about Benacerraf's dilemma, which says that there is a difficult choice to be made between ontology and epistemology. Either we have an easy account of what numbers are, but explaining knowledge is difficult, or vice versa.",
    "From this we will move on to the rival view that there are no mathematical objects after all, focusing on Jody Azzouni's nominalist fictionalism.",
    "Finally, I'll talk a bit about Madeline Muntersbjorn's argument that the created/discovered dichotomy is a false one, that mathematical objects are instead \"cultivated\".",
