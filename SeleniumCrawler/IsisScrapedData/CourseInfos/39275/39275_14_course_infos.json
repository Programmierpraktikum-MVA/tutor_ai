    "Abstract:",
    "The presentation discusses the role of measurements in power systems, with a particular focus on smart grids. First,\nthe basic concepts of metrology (the science of measurement) are given. Then, an overview is provided of the instrument transformers and sensors used for collecting electric quantities. The presentation continues with the challenges that experts and\nresearchers are facing due to the integration of renewable energy sources\nin the power network. Finally, some interesting applications are described, along with insights into the Italian electric market and its actors.",
