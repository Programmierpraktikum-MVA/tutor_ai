    "Introduction",
    "Welcome to the Bachelor's Course in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). In today's rapidly aging population and evolving technological landscape, the concept of Ambient Assisted Living has gained significant importance. AAL leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance the quality of life for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, allowing them to maintain their independence while receiving the support they need. The project-based course,",
    "Ambient Assisted Living",
    "deals with how we can use technology to make our everyday life easier, more comfortable, more efficient, and more accessible. The focus here is how we can optimize the interaction with intelligent, networked devices and adapt it to the actual needs and wishes of the users.",
    "The course focuses on indoor environments seeking to shape the future of indoor smart spaces such as residential buildings, offices, hospitals etc.",

    "This project aims to enhance the Smart Desk and Smart Chair systems with advanced functionalities. For the Smart Desk, improvements include a new app with features for water measurement and lighting optimization, along with enhanced biofeedback capabilities. The Smart Chair upgrades involve adding multiple sensors to the armrests for proximity, height adjustment, and occupancy indication, alongside firmware enhancements for better personalization and integration with the desk system. Additional features include an Ergonomic Assistant that uses sensory data to monitor and optimize posture, provide biofeedback, and display environmental data. A comprehensive desk booking system with server deployment will also be developed to facilitate real-time interaction and reservation status updates.",
