    "This is a short video by Mark Jago of Nottingham University, explaining truth trees for first-order logic. This uses the same presentation style as we have seen, so could be helpful if anyone wants an extra bit of explanation. He has quite a lot of videos on this topic, and they are all good, so if you want other similar explanations, have a look through his youtube channel.",

    "This version of the ForallX textbook contains chapters on trees, which the others don't. Pages 71-87 contain the introduction to trees, and pages 181-200 contain the FOL trees. One thing to note is that he uses slightly different symbols for negation, implication and the biconditional. It also keeps track of line numbers and which rule you are applying in the tree, which I did not do. Otherwise, though, this might help to explain some of the key ideas when you are styudying by yourself.",
