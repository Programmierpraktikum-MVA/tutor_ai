    "In this session we will learn how to do truth table for propositional logic. First of all this will mean learning how the truth of a complex formula depends on the truth of its propositional variables. Next, we can see how we can test for formal validity using truth tables.",

    "If you search for truth table generators online, you will find many. I did some investigating, and this is the one that looks most like what I have taught you. In particular, it lets you do multiple formulas next to each other to check for validity like I taught you. This is extra helpful for checking your answers, or generating some extra examples if you are unsure."
