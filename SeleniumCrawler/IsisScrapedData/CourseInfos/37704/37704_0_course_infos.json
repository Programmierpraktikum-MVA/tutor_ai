    "Background",
    "Decisions around land use and land \nmanagement have wide-reaching impact on a variety of ecological metrics \nincluding soil chemistry, microclimate, and biodiversity. Contrasting \nthe ecology of various land types ranging from urban, suburban, \nagricultural, or more natural habitat such as forested area, can provide\n us information regarding these land uses’ role in climate change, \nnutrient pollution, and overall ecological health. Furthermore, urban \necology always includes a human dimension, invoking sociopolitical and \nhistorical dimensions related to land use, with environmental outcomes \nof such decisions not evenly distributed among all populations.",
    "Urban\n green spaces are widely encouraged for their potential to provide a \nvariety of ecosystem services including climate mitigation (either \nlocally through reduction in urban heat island effect or globally \nthrough their potential to sequester carbon), promotion of biodiversity,\n stormwater management, and more. As part of this course, we will \ncollect ecologic samples from a centrally located urban park, an urban \nforest, and a forest on the outskirts of the city in Brandenburg. Data \ncollected will include soil cores, plant data, and other ecologic \nmetrics. These contexts will be contrasted to help to assess differences\n in ecologic conditions, considering what this may mean for urban land \nmanagement.",
    "Objectives",
    "To consider how different types of urban green spaces function ecologically and to assess similarities and differences.",
    "To learn how to collect and process ecologic data from different land use types",
    "To learn how to process, analyze, and visualize ecologic collected data using tools such as Excel and RStudio.",
    "To create a brief presentation conveying information about urban green spaces, their ecologic function, history, and value.",
    "Central Questions",
    "How can the type of green space impact ecosystem services such as \nnutrient cycling, water management, climate mitigation, or supporting \nbiodiversity? What are implications for urban planning and policy?",
    "How can understanding the history of decisions related to land use and \nland management help us understand the impacts of these decisions in the\n long-term? How can we incorporate perspectives of environmental justice\n when considering decisions related to land use and land management?",
