    "Welcome to \"Modern Mass Spectrometry for Proteins\" (MMS).Â  Lectures and seminars will take place each Tuesday (8-10am) and Friday (3-5pm) during the winter term. This course is especially suited for students considering a master \nthesis in our group. However, apart from teaching you recent \ndevelopments in the field of mass spectrometry this course is meant to prepare each of you for work in science, be it during your Master \nthesis or a PhD. Therefore, we will work on two main blocks in this course (softskills and mass spectrometry) . Mass spectrometry and softskill lectures will take place during the weekly lecture slot on Tuesday/Friday. In addition, mass spectrometry lectures by external speakers are part of the \"Systems Biology Lectures (Ringvorlesung) on Proteins and Proteomics\" organized at the MDC. These lectures will take place on Wednesdays - they are optional to extend (except noted otherwise). It is highly recommended to check the weekly lectures for mass spectrometry based proteomics.",
    "How we perceive this course: We want you to learn and have fun in this course. You will have a major role in the quality and design of the course. Each of you will have the chance to prepare a 30-minute talk for your fellow-students and get immediate feedback from the audience (that is you!) and us. Thereby, we all together can identify our weaknesses and strengths and improve them (and our own).",
