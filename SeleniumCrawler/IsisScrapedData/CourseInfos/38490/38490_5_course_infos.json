    "In this session we look more closely at surface energy and consider it's significance.",
    "Specifically learning outcomes will address the following questions:",
    "1) How does surface energy depend on surface termination of a nanomaterial?",
    "2) What are the available pathways for a nanomaterial to reduce free energy?",
    "3) How do geometry and surface structure determine phase stability of a nanoparticle?",
    "4) What is a nanocluster ?",
    "5) What kind of properties are driven by surfaces?",
    "6) How does surface energy pose a barrier to the formation of nanoparticles?",
