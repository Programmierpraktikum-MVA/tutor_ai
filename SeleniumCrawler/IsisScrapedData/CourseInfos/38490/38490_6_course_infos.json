    "In this lecture we reexamine surfaces energy and its role in governing total-free energy in a system.",
    "We then look at the interplay of surface and bulk and consider how a metastable phase may in fact be the most stable form of a material in nano-scale forms.",
    "Students are expected to understand the following:",
    "1. What is the total free energy of a system composed of?",
    "2. How do exposed surfaces and their termination govern phase stability and formation",
    "3. What is a metastable phase?",
    "4. Why is phase formation important in",
