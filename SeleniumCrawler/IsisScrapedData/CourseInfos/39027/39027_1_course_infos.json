    "Welcome to the seminar \"School Systems and Teaching in international comparative perspectives\"!",
    "The seminar is offered to exchange students from the partner universities of the School of Education TU Berlin as well as to students from TU Berlin and other Berlin universities (as \"Freie Wahl\"). It therefore offers the opportunity to exchange with prospective teachers from other national contexts and education systems.",
    "Together we will take a look at (national) school systems and their underlying (social and cultural) values. This seminar is meant to be a co-learning event in the sense that together we will develop questions and content, listen to and learn from each other during exchange of opinions and try to not judge on others but learn to express our own arguments. We will do so using the English language to make everyone be able to participate but keep in mind that for most of us English is not the first language.",
