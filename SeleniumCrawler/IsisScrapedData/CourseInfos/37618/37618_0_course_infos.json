    "Content",
    "In modern drug discovery, computational methods facilitate the evaluation of the binding affinity and kinetics for protein-ligand binding, therefore guiding the choice of the best candidate molecules for experimental tests and further development. In this course, students will learn the basic steps involved in drug design, from target selection to clinical trials, and which steps can be assisted by computational methods. Students will have a basic understanding of the core concepts involved in ligand-based and structure-based drug design, and will learn practical skills in drug design, such as the use of databases, web servers and software.",
    "The course will address theoretical and practical aspects of the following topics:",
    "- databases to find purchasable small molecules",
    "- calculation of molecular similarity",
    "- choice of target protein",
    "- identification of druggable binding sites in proteins",
    "- protein-ligand docking",
    "- molecular dynamics simulations",
    "- prediction of binding free energies and kinetic rates for protein-ligand complexes using data-driven and physics-based methods",
    "- molecular property descriptors and Lipinski’s rule-of-five",
    "- absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) properties",
