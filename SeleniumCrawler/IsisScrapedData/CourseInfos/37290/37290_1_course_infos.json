    "In this module, you will learn about the potential of ICE (Integrated Collaborative Engineering) to support integrated systems engineering. To this end, we will confront you with a design challenge for a complex civil engineered product that you have to solve through intensive collaborative group work. In this way, this hands-on project-based module will provide you with the possibility to experience collaborative engineering design in a simulated practical environment. You will understand the real difficulties in model integration and learn techniques to overcome these problems through collaboration and concurrent work. An important focus of the course is to teach how to visualize engineering ideas in detail within media rich interdisciplinary workspaces (the class will be taught within the civil system group's ICE room).",
