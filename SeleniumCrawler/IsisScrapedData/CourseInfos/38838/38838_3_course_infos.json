    "In this first component of the course we will look at the scope of materials used in the built environment and how materials and their industrial processing have evolved to shape and be shaped by the way we live our lives in these built environments.",
    "We will examine the requirements we place on the materials in our built environment and how we can address these sustainably through responsible use of the",
    "resources",
    "available to us on this planet.",
    "We will focus on the motivation and rationale for studying the materials in our built environment from the perspective of ceramics and see how understanding of basic composition, processing and properties of minerals and ceramics can be applied to design effective building materials that rise to the architectural and engineering challenges of the day.",
    "We will examine the overall development of materials over time and examine how the lifecycle of our construction materials and our built environment has changed as the result of materials industrialization, increased energy usage and population growth. We will examine how materials design of the future can be conducted to make ceramic materials an ally in achieving a sustainable interface with the multiple spheres of our environment.",
