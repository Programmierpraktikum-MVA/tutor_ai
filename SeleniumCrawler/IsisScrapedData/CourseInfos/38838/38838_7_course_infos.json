    "To turn a body of dried clay into a ceramic article, high temperature thermal processing is required. Known as firing, this is best carried out in a gas fired tunnel kiln.",
    "In this lecture we examine the development of clayware firing methods over history and see the challenging requirements of effective firing methods.",
    "As with drying, the control of of air-flow and temperature are paramount in the firing of ceramics in order to reliably and cheaply produce high quality products such as bricks and tiles.",
