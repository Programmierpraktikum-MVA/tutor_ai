    "Glass is a very special material in numerous ways. Unlike most solids, which are usually crystalline, glass does not exhibit a distinct melting point at which a rigid solid becomes a liquid. Instead glass exhibits a glass transition, whereby an increasingly viscous liquid becomes a rigid solid with cooling.",
    "The transparency of glass and our ability to shape it and reshape it into diverse forms makes this material very useful in the built environment.",
    "The most common form of glass in our world is Soda Lime Glass.",
    "We look here at the processing of glass with a focus on flat glass intended for use in the built environment.",
