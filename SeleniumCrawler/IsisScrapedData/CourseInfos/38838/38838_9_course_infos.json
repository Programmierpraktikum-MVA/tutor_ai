    "In this component of our course we examine Cement. Cement is the key ingredient that makes concrete possible. Concrete has changed the face of our earth and dominates our built environment. By mass, concrete is predominantly aggregate and sand, however the hydraulic activity of cement, in which reactions with water form a new cementitious phase that binds these particles together, is what gives this material its versatility and strength.",
