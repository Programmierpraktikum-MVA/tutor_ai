    "The lifecycle of materials in the built environment is the key to their sustainable implementation. We have already seen that considerable emissions and environmental degradation occur in the course of producing clayware and concrete. During the use of materials in the built environment their microstructure and performance may degrade.",
    "In this session we examine several topics",
    "What are the stages in a materials life cycle",
    "What are the vectors for materials degradation and failure",
    "What are some considerations for end of life in terms of recycling and disposal.",
    "Circular construction",
    "Masonry Sealants",
    "Some information on the alkali-silica reaction",
