    "Clayware, specifically bricks and tiles, are widely used in the built environment.",
    "Global production of clayware amounts to several hundreds of millions of tons per year.",
    "Brick production accounts for ~6% of global carbon emissions (according toÂ International\ninstitute for applied systems analysis)",
    "Drying of bricks (typically at temperatures not exceeding 120C) often consumes more energy than firing them (at temperatures often exceeding 1000C) although waste heat from kilns may provide some or all of this energy requirement",
    "The enthalpy, water content and temperature of air determine drying kinetics",
    "Following drying - clayware is fired, resulting in the decomposition of clay minerals, and various reactions that may involve silicate, aluminosilicate and carbonate phases.",
    "Understanding the what goes on in drying and firing is important for the efficient production of good bricks",
    "Nowadays, an emerging trend is the use of unfired clay, or earth in construction. This is likely to be the dominant method for construction in a post-industrial society. There are numerous advantages of using unfired clay in construction. In particular the regulation of temperature and humidity, as well as the absence of mold, the recyclability and the potential for harmonising our activities with the world around us.
