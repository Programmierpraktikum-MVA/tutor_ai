    "Cement hardens by reaction of hydraulic phases with water.",
    "Pozzolans also participate in the hydration of cement and react with Calcium Hydroxide to form more strength-giving phases",
    "Various reactions occur when cement sets. These depend on the composition of the cement, the grain size, and the water content. In this lecture we will look at hydration of cement, the phases and microstructures formed in this process and how they affect the performance of concrete applied in the built environment",
    "We will examine some approaches to reducing the significant carbon emissions associated with the use of concrete in general and portland cement clinker in particular.",
