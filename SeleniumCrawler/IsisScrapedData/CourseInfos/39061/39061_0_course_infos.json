    "This collaborative design studio will focus on the physical linkages between energy, mobility, waste management and buildings in different geographic settings in Africa and Latin America. The design concepts will consider policy and finance aspects and apply co-development approaches. Cross-sectoral, gender-sensitive living labs  act as blueprints for local implementation actions in the selected partner countries and beyond. Studio participants will have the opportunity to exchange with decision-makers, technical staff and entrepreneurs in the co-design process.",
    "This studio supports on-going research and implementation projects through  improving synergies between key sectors and fostering local innovation in transformative living labs with the aim to contribute to sustainable urban development.",
    "The PIV linked to the studio is realized in cooperation with UN-Habitat, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Wuppertal Institute and local project partners.",
